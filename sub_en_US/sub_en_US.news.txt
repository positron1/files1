When good times lasted too long, businesses and individuals threw caution to the wind and behaved badly.

It was really scary."

8. Ronnell Lewis, Oklahoma, 6-2, 253. This early entrant probably won't fit in a 4-3 scheme. He needs to be in a 3-4. Lewis is a madman on the field and plays fast. He is quick, explosive and athletic. He does not make plays he should, however. He should be a fine special teams player.
Meanwhile, Hank and Wu are tracking down leads back in Portland. After calling on Holly's distraught mother, Hank finds out that there's a link between the forest area and a former neighbor of Holly's. You don't need to be Monroe to know that this smells suspicious -- especially since the suspect, Addison, looks so guilty when Hank calls on him. Even more suspicious, Addison had an alibi the day Holly disappeared -- he had been bitten by a wild dog hiking on Mount Hood and was in the hospital. Ah, but what hospital? Beaverton Community Hospital! Why drive all the way to Beaverton when you're in terrible pain, Hank wonders. Poor Beaverton -- dissed again.

Indeed, the "uninsured crisis" itself is properly regarded as a symptom, not a cause, of high costs. The insured consume two and a half times as much health care as the uninsured. This massive consumption is largely a result of being insured, and therefore immunized from the direct cost of health care. It's as if you paid a $10 co-pay for a tank of gas and your car insurer paid the balance. The roads would be even more congested than they are now! Further, one third to one half of this spending does not contribute to better health. The blunt fact is that most of us are overinsured<U+0097>but few of us are prepared to accept that fact, so most politicians ignore it.

Ryan Williams, RB, Cardinals: Tim Hightower is in Washington now and Beanie Wells has failed to seize the workhorse role envisioned when he was drafted in 2009. Enter Williams, a big-play threat with the potential to jumpstart the league's worst rushing attack.

He referred to House Bill 920, a 1976 state law that mandates rising property millage must be lowered proportionate to increasing home values so that levies collect the same amount of money.

But the three plaintiffs in the Winona case make strong arguments about how rental restrictions can put homeowners who need to rent in a bind. One cannot sell a home because potential buyers know it cannot be rented out.
Studies show that first and second generation immigrants favor making English the official language of the United States — and that they do so, in fact, at a higher rate than the general American population. If opposition to illegal immigration were what the Official English movement is about, surely this would not be the case. People come to America with the expectation that we speak English here and that they need to learn English in order to be successful.

Do you see any thematic connection between your work in documentaries and your work in fiction films? In all my films, I'm interested in larger-than-life characters. But in documentaries, I'm trying to take the chaos of real life and make it as compelling as fiction, while in fiction films, I'm trying to make a made-up story seem like reality. So in a way they are opposites and use different parts of my brain. It's like the difference between journalism and art.
This seemed like a splendid idea to us and we were very curious. When we told our fathers of our plans they raised no objections. I guess they recalled their own boyhood days and considered going to a burlesque show a rite of passage.
18. Mike Haridopolos, state Senate president (Last year: 16th). The Brevard County Republican carries a lot of clout as dean of the state Senate. And he'd probably carry even more if he wasn't eclipsed by another Dean … Cannon, the House speaker who ran the legislative show. The future for Haridopolos, 41, depends on how he performs in 2012 — as well as his future plans.

Publicly, the U.S. and Chinese governments have said nothing about the Chen case.

Instead, Richmeyer narrowed his choices to a couple sports - golf and tennis - and looked over their schedules. That's all there was to it.
The Cardinals expected pitching to be their strength this season. So the loss of Chris Carpenter for at least a few months punches a hole in their rotation. Even if Lance Lynn does a solid job filling in, the Cards will miss Carpenter's leadership and his love of big-game challenges. Adam Wainwright will fill some of the leadership void, but a hole will remain.

3. Memo to Major League Baseball: You’ve got to do something about how you calculate blown saves. It’s a crime that Dolis got charged with a blown save on Thursday when he entered with a one-run lead, bases loaded and no outs, and then got a double-play grounder that allowed the tying run to score. There’s no way that should be held against him, not Marmol, who officially remained only 2-for-4 in save situations. The guy that creates the meltdown should bear the statistical blame. Why not do it this way? If a reliever enters in a save situation and leaves with runners on second or third base, who eventually score to tie the game, the pitcher who put them on base is charged with a blown save. Something’s got to change.
I have planted ice plant, portaluca, aloes, snapdragons, some small cactuses and other succulents. Nothing but the aloes are thriving. The snapdragons and vinca flower anemically during the winter and wilt during the summer. The cactuses get etiolated in the winter and sunburned in the summer. Is there anything other than aloes that will thrive in winter shade and summer sun?
While Acta is trying to keep the rotation together, it was rumored Thursday night that the Indians were close to trading for veteran outfielder/DH Bobby Abreu of the Angels.

Three picks later, cornerback Stephon Gilmore from South Carolina was shuffling off to Buffalo.

From his first film, 1988's masterful semi-autobiographical "Distant Voices, Still Lives," Davies attracted notice for bringing modern filmmaking attitudes and formidable skill to classic emotional stories, often with women at their center, that exposed the pain that can accompany romantic relationships.

I wait to make sure that all cars see me and that I'm getting a visual clue that I can cross. I never seek to enforce my right of way. I don't expect to hold up well against a Buick. A friendly wave and acknowledgement goes a long way to encourage drivers to be more careful when approaching crosswalks."

Quiner noted that the medical board has gained prominence because of the controversy about telemedicine systems that deliver abortion pills. The issue erupted about three years ago, when Planned Parenthood of the Heartland pioneered a system to allow big-city doctors to distribute abortion pills to patients in small-town clinics.

She takes the first pill as the doctor watches via video. Then she goes home, takes the remaining pills and has what amounts to an induced miscarriage.

No part of the Cardinals team had a bigger in-season overhaul than the bullpen, which turned out to be one of the units integral to the team's success.

The details: Amid all the candied, overwrought specimens of Zinfandel that have left their original partisans scowling, there's still room for hope. Look no further the 2008 Storybook Mountain Mayacamas Range Estate Napa Valley Zinfandel ($34, 14.7%), a savory, floral take on Napa Zin that smells like plums and tulips in a wooden window box.

Wine of some sort has been made in North America since the 1500s. In the 1800s, there were significant commercial wineries in California, Missouri, Ohio and New York (Finger Lakes region), and those are just the biggies.

By the '70s and '80s, advances in science and technology provided by University of California-Davis and other research facilities helped us take off in winemaking. Today (deserved or not), we hold a seat at the table of fine-wine producers around the world.

Looking over that list, it's clear that there are few consensus players who emerge as the clear choice for any defensive awards. Buehrle, the St. Charles native, is one. Gardner sure appears like he should get some run as the best defensive left fielder -- which is a little like saying the left fielder who should be playing center. Jackson stands out as perhaps the best center fielder in the majors. (Aside: Bourjos was second in the majors to Jackson with a plus-24.)
O’Malley deserves all the benefit of the doubt, but surely understands Dodgers fans are going to have one difficult time with the concept. It’s a story brought to you by Shirley MacLaine’s astrologist.
The James Beard Foundation's Best of the Best, by Kit Wohl (Chronicle Books; 240 pages; $60): This season's coffee table book focuses on 21 chefs from around the country, detailing through their bios, menus, recipes and photos, their contributions to the culinary landscape as we know - and knew - it. Locally speaking, there are chapters on Alice Waters, Thomas Keller and Judy Rodgers, whose recipes for dishes like a salmon bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich are surprisingly doable.

Now, I nominated Richard for this job last summer, so you may be wondering why am I appointing him today. It would be a good question. (Laughter.) For almost half a year, Republicans in the Senate have blocked Richard's confirmation.
But they got Kucinich some ink, which is his lifeblood, and they allowed him to play the role he has perfected: the underdog who knows the whole world is against him, but who relentlessly pursues what he knows to be right, consequences be damned.

Write it down. If you're doing an internship for credit, you'll probably be asked to create a portfolio of your work to be graded. But take the time to do what Sarah Jackson did when she was doing her internship at the Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site. The McKendree University junior kept a log of what she did, but also of what she learned. It's a great way to chart your progress and to reinforce the knowledge or skills you've gained.

Groups involved in the referendum effort, however, do not want lawmakers to repeal HB 194. The referendum must go on, they said, because the people have said they want to vote on the law. Plus, worries persist among these groups that GOP lawmakers will slip provisions into new legislation that would make it harder for minorities and poor people to vote - the root of their objections to HB 194.

"I'm not sure how well Ronald Reagan would do in today's highly partisan environment," said Stephen Knott, an author of two books on Reagan and professor of national security studies at the U.S. Naval War College.

Personal story: "After being the runner up in the IHSA State Track Meet in May 2011, I had made plans to train all summer and fall in order to become a better thrower in the 2012 track and field season and hopefully win a state championship. During the summer of 2011, I suffered an ACL tear during a basketball game. This injury immediatley ceased any plans that I had of training during the summer and also kept me from participating in the other sports that I had always played prior to the injury. After my surgery, I slowly began trying to lift weights and practiced my throwing by sitting in a chair so I wasn't using my legs. Six months later, in January 2012, I was able to participate in track and really begin training for my goals. I currently am still working and competing and have been able to stay pretty consistent with where I left off last season. This injury has been difficult to deal with and a long one to recover from. I do think that it has made me a stronger person and will continue to daily work in order to hopefully achieve my goals. I think that when an individual deals with an obstacle in his/her life, it can truly make that person stronger."

A: That's luck. That's where luck enters a director's career. Because many directors can do sincere and honest work, but they don't always have the luck that what they are doing either entertains or appeals to or connects with an audience -- a large-enough audience to allow them to keep on making films on the scale at which they're making them.

LeBron and whatever poor soul guards him. Iman Shumpert may get the first crack in a cross-match, and while the rookie is undeniably ahead of the curve, he’s still a rookie. And after he sits down with three fouls midway through the first quarter, Carmelo Anthony will take a shot at it and then decided it’s more fun to expend energy at the other end. Past, prologue: The last time they played, Melo had 42 and the Knicks still lost.

Of course I have. I've been to Brussels, lifelong home of Tintin's creator, Georges Prosper Remi, better known by his comic book nom de plume, Hergé. Fans and scholars of the strip — a serious tribe known as Tintinologists — may recall an often-reproduced photo of Hergé, posed with a natty cane and bowler hat at the market on the Place du Jeu de Balle in the funky-chic Marolles district of Brussels, where collectors sell vintage postcards, dubious Old Master paintings, threadbare Oriental rugs, broken lamps and model ships just like the one Tintin finds at the opening of the film. On a Sunday morning, the Jeu de Balle flea market is one of my favorite places because of its Tintin connections.

"There is a great deal of gray, in terms of his responsibility. That will come out at trial." McTigue said the plea offer was the best Baskerville could expect and is now off the table, though Bini believed negotiations would be ongoing.
Hey, Jack: As of now, the Cavs stand to shed $31.5 million in payroll when O'Neal's and Ilgauskas' contracts expire next summer. However, the Cavs are way, way over the salary cap and deep into the luxury tax. So that doesn't mean they'll be $30 million under the cap. While they will potentially have some cap space, it's nothing close to what it would take to offer a maximum contract to a player like Bosh. Unless, of course, James signs elsewhere. It is because of this fact that there will be heavy consideration to make a trade before the deadline.
The bureau already has the cameras, and the footage could be accessed remotely on officers' smartphones or laptops.
Nelson Cruz hit his third career slam and like Elvis Andrus matched a career high with four hits as the Rangers handed Jered Weaver (5-1) his first loss.

At the same time, the agency predicts that production increases will be small or even decline in non-OPEC countries. And OPEC's reserve capacity - extra oil that it could produce in an emergency - will get smaller, opening the door to periodic price spikes.
But since then, we've seen President Barack Obama forced to compromise on an ill-considered mandate requiring religious institutions to provide contraception to their employees. We've seen the GOP convene an all-male panel to testify on women's reproductive concerns. We've seen debate over Title X, a 1970 law providing free contraception to indigent women. We've been treated to Rick Santorum's bizarre views on contraception, which he opposes because he says it doesn't work (!) and is dangerous and harmful to women, to boot.
The Cardinals were sent away with a 14-8 April that did not include a series sweep. Sunday's setback became only their second loss when outhitting an opponent; it also became their fourth loss in five one-run games.
All this might sound like a meat-centric menu, but it's not.

Serve: Fry calamari by cleaning 1 pound of squid and cutting into 1/2-inch rings. Dust with all-purpose flour and season with salt and pepper to taste. Pour enough oil into a large saucepan to reach a depth of 3 inches. Heat on medium-high, and when hot, carefully add squid in batches. Be careful not to overcrowd the pan. Fry until crisp, about 1 minute per batch. Use tongs or a slotted spoon to transfer calamari to paper-towel-lined plates to drain. Serve with lemon wedges.

Helpful Hints: Don't skimp on the candles: Buy thick pillars with one wick that will melt only in the center. Sequins, pins and brads can be found at craft markets, but sewing stores, fabric outlets and bead stores might carry more unusual baubles.
Nixon, who placed loyalty and trust above all, wanted to keep Haig close and promoted him ahead of 240 other generals to vice chief of staff of the Army, the branch's No. 2 position, despite the fact that Haig had never commanded a division. Shortly thereafter, in May 1973, Nixon made him his chief of staff to replace H.R. Haldeman.

Burk is close to making his career dreams come true, but he lives on a lower salary, waits tables, lives with his parents and takes nursing-assistant classes at Glendale Community College. Eventually, Burk said, he would like to be a nurse.
Another argument in favor of raising age limits for judges contends that Ohio has no comparable age limits for other public officials. This ignores the particular circumstances that apply to the environment of the bench, as opposed to other public offices. Compared to other officials, judges lead a somewhat cloistered existence, professionally. While it might become readily apparent to staff and others that an elected official is having difficulty, it might not in the case of a judge, since the average judge has fewer direct contacts.
In this case, uSocial was using software to vote, Hill said.

Kevin Garnett had 15 points and 12 rebounds, while Bradley, who shifted over to take Rondo's spot at the point, chipped in with 14 points but only three assists — a far cry from what the Celtics usually get out of that position.
PG&E inspected Line 109 in 2009 using a method that was incapable of finding flawed seam welds. Yet two stretches of the line have such welds, according to PG&E records. PG&E officials have said they had been intentionally boosting the pressure on lines with such welds every five years or so since 2003, but stopped the practice after the San Bruno explosion. The company says it had been elevating the pressure because federal regulations - based on peak pressure levels - would otherwise kick in and limit its ability to meet peak demand.

Although Shires no longer has a Texas address, a dusty High Plains breeze blows straight through "Carrying Lightning." She writes poetically of old fencing and bailing wire, dogwood and mimosa trees, and ceiling fans that can’t seem to keep pace with the heat. Her love stories seem to be set in farmhouses under the roaring Lone Star sun; it’s here where her characters surrender to desire and yearn to break free. Many of her narrators are struggling against their restraints and racing toward abandon and the promise of passion. On "She Let Go of Her Kite," Shires’ protagonist is literally taken by the wind; it’s with violently mixed emotions that she allows her prized and lovingly patched possession to get swept up into the Texas sky. ("Carrying Lightning" will be released on May 3.)

A:I had lunch with a 73-year-old who was a Little in the 1940s. He had great stories to tell about the impact it has. He is now becoming a Big and was matched with a 6-year-old. That's really neat. The perception is that this is only for people in their 20s, but that's not true. Mentors must be at least age 18 but must be ready and willing to put time into the child. People either meet it or they don't. Mentors come in all different forms. The criterion is: Do you have the time?
Usama Young will start at strong safety for Ward. Alex Smith probably will replace Marecic as the fullback. Also available is Eddie Williams, who was promoted this week from the practice squad.

Kendrick stars as the sort of leader of the group, a married father of two. After a family tragedy, he comes up with the idea of a fatherhood pledge that he urges his partner (Downes), two other colleagues (Bevel and Ben Davies) and a friend Javier (Robert Amaya) to sign as well.
Journalists often say that Zé “disappeared” in the 1980s, but he says he continued to perform in the state of São Paulo. Zé’s reemergence came as a result of a surprise call from David Byrne in 1990.

Luaka Bop issued a collection of Zé’s songs and then several other discs, helping Zé find new audiences worldwide.

The reigning NL MVP became the first player to hit three home runs in a game at spacious Petco Park since it opened in 2004. His power show came several days after the Padres said they are studying bringing in the fences at the downtown ballpark to make it more fair.
"Most of the time a full-scholarship player is one who can pitch for you on the weekend and hit in the middle of the order right out of the gate," Fox said.

Another caveat: Many dividend-paying stocks are financial firms whose prices have taken a beating since the crisis and who remain on shaky ground.

And as a food lover, it would be wrong not to take advantage of modern opportunities -- access to better ingredients, techniques, influences from other cultures. In Jersey City, the sandbox is full of children from different cultures, the grocery shelves stocked with ingredients that not so long ago seemed quite exotic. And Lyons is an inquisitive, creative chef, with an appreciation for other cuisines. Why wouldn't he try new things?

But federal law makes all marijuana possession and sales illegal. Drug sales within 1,000 feet of a school bring enhanced penalties.

Arkema admits to concern at first about how the locals in heavily conservative west Michigan would react to profane or raunchy acts. Some shows are promoted as "clean comedy nights," so it's clear by inference that some are not.
In Song's biggest scam, she forged signatures on 32 payment vouchers submitted to her former employer, a medical device company. The company paid her $127,122 before spotting the forgeries.

Despite these different perspectives, Obama presented Israel with a strong case for patience. Sanctions, he said, are "slowing the Iranian nuclear program and virtually grinding the Iranian economy to a halt." They also may have drawn Iran back to the negotiating table; on Tuesday it was announced that negotiations would be resumed between Tehran and the U.S., France, Britain, China, Russia and Germany. It is far too early to give up on diplomacy — or, as Obama said at his news conference, "this notion that somehow we have a choice to make in the next week or two weeks, or month or two months, is not borne out by the facts."
"Pictures" originally was scheduled to premiere in January 2004, but after postponing it a week, the orchestra ended up pushing it back a year. Then that event, too, fell through.

Some of the more upscale developments are so handsomely designed and offer so many amenities -- shopping, restaurants, bars serving happy hours, on-site concierges, movie theaters, libraries, art studios, fitness centers, Olympic-size pools, safety features, beautifully landscaped grounds -- that Zaayer wonders if aging baby boomers will find themselves "running to these places."

ABOUT THE CAPITALS: While media and fans scrutinize Hunter's personnel decisions, the players say they support their coach all the way. "To be honest, it's not even something that we notice," said Capitals defenseman Karl Alzner. "We don't go down the sheet at the end of the game and say, 'How much did 'Ovi' play?' You know he wants to play more, and he's frustrated by not playing 20 minutes. But he doesn't care - he wants to win that game." Part of the reason for the diminished ice time is the play of Washington's third and fourth lines, which have performed well in the postseason.
You called about the porn bill run up by your teenage visitor.

“In a nutshell, its been co-opted by the industry, so on one hand they have some mission of only supporting ‘independent’ stores, but then the bulk of releases are overpriced crap from major labels - the same ones that tried to destroy indie stores back when they had any power in the 1990s,” Steinhardt says. “On top of that, I think the collector culture of vinyl is really dangerous for the longevity of the format. So while this day claims to be celebrating the format, by being all about limited ephemera and not about music, it’s rapidly speeding up the music industry’s demise.”

Even though spinal stenosis is caused by arthritis in the back, back pain is not the most common symptom. People with spinal stenosis most often notice pain in the buttocks, along with weakness, numbness or pain in their legs when they stand, walk or try to lie flat.

That's what is being whispered in the ear of every player who comes to the par-5 seventh hole at Big Met in Fairview Park. Do you belt the drive 240 or more yards around the trees, challenge a drainage area and set up for a mid-iron approach and a likely birdie? Or do you respect the odds that a slightly wayward drive will be severely punished, play short off the tee and set up a pitch with a chance to beat par?

And therein lies the paradox that permeates the book. Living alone works best as a lifestyle choice when it actually leads to greater connection. Every singleton interviewed, even the most enthusiastic, had at least some reservations or worries: pangs about not having children or questions about spending too much time at the office, poignant questions about failed marriages or the lack of a long-term relationship, fear of facing illness or death alone. But in this way, the author notes, single people are no different from those living with a partner. They "struggle with loneliness or the feeling that they need to change something to make their lives feel more complete," writes Klinenberg. "But so, too, do their married friends and family members. ..." In other words, we're all in the same boat.

Watson was born and raised in Philadelphia. In her early years she found a love for dance, music and children, which led her to pursue her bachelor's degree in Special Education from West Chester University. Her interest in helping others prompted her journey to obtain an master's in School Counseling from Loyola University. Watson uses a variety of approaches to positively impact student reading at City Neighbors: an annual 25-book challenge for each student, one-on-one conferences to help students select books that are just right for them, and the occasional special focus on poetry and plays. This year in particular, she has used arts integration as a way to tap into the students' love and understanding of reading through bookmaking, movement, dance, and drama.

Skylar went country, of course, with Jason Aldean's "Tattoos on This Town." But here's the thing. She tends to overdo the twang on proper country songs, pulling it back enough on songs that fall outside her comfort zone to seem more like an honest country singer than a theme-park cartoon of a country singer. What I'm getting at is it was fine but I believed her as a country singer more when she was doing Queen.

Instead, Netflix tailors its recommendations by relying on data that users provide on their profiles, plus information about past rentals -- including whether you stopped watching a streaming video and never resumed it and the speed at which you go through rentals -- and ratings you give to movies.

Followed so soon by Bozek's announcement, the timing seemed more than coincidental to some in the Polish Catholic community. Perhaps Carlson was preparing to return Wojcicki to his former parish to put things back together there after a deal is done, they thought.
Senior Elise Viox, a standout during the cross county season before an injury sidelined her late in the fall, is expected to compete in the 800- and 1,600-meter races and also be a key part of the 3,200-relay team. But that could change as the season goes along.

The size of the seats is not a function of passenger weight but a legacy of airplane design from a generation ago, said Vern Alg, a former airline executive who is now a private consultant.

Grohl is a wiseguy, but he was dead serious about his obligation to provide maximum entertainment at wall-shaking volume. His band — as tight and taut as a guitar string after months of touring behind their latest album, "Wasting Light" — played for nearly three hours, and he spent much of that time running around the stage like a spray-paint vandal chased by the cops.
Solution: There's not much a team can do to prevent injuries such as Michael Brantley's broken right hamate bone and Choo's broken left thumb. Head athletic trainer Lonnie Soloff and his staff did research the oblique and hamstring issues the Indians had last year.

"Rick has paid his price for past violations," Koenig said. "And I think the number of violations people are throwing around are gross misrepresentations of the situation.

And remember, I’m only talking about scripted, feature films here. I’m not even going to go into all the surreality-TV shows that picture us as a state full of violent, orange-skinned thugs with petroleum-slicked hairdos and painfully inflated chests. (And those are just the women.)
“I don’t believe in sending song files all over the world,” says Birch, whose recordings have the immediacy of a live performance. “There’s something magical that happens when you get a group of musicians together in the same place. In New Orleans, I was in the studio with George Porter, and it was inspiring to have such an amazing artist right there in the live room, playing on my songs.”
"That's the part of the game that's gotten away the last four is my relentlessness on the puck," Oshie said. "I got that back. I wasn't going to focus on setting up the play. I was going to focus on being relentless and let the skill take over after my work ethic does."

Buffalo receiver Steve Johnson apologized for a touchdown celebration against the Jets in which he pretended to shoot himself in the leg, a la Jets receiver Plaxico Burress in a New York nightclub a few years back.

On Sept. 12, 2001, I wrote a letter to The Sun hoping (praying) that my nation would respond to the Sept. 11 attacks with swift justice rather than protracted war; that we would thoughtfully and strategically aim to increase peace rather than compound violence. We've been warring for 10 years now, and at such cost of lives and treasure — over 5,000 American soldiers and many, many times that in civilian deaths and hundreds of billions of dollars.

Hey, Tony: Read your article about kickers becoming "too good." I'd like to get your opinion on the following rule change which would take effect when I become king: On kickoffs, if the ball is kicked out-of-bounds on the fly, penalty places the ball on the 40, as presently. If it bounces or rolls out-of-bounds before getting to the end zone, the receiving team takes possession at that yard line, just like a punt. I think the change would add an interesting element to the game, requiring more precision than distance kicking, and may cause receiving teams to use two returners to cover the field, reducing the number of blockers by one, or risk bad field position. BTW, I happen to enjoy watching teams (not QB'd by Elway) try to succeed in 90-yard drives. -- Seren Hrachian, Athens, N.Y.

Instead of the crying/I'm sad phase, I'm pretty much in the ticked-off phase at the moment. I'm mad that this is allowed to happen. I'm so angry that the hotel industry allowed this to happen so easily. And I'm mad that our government and our laws allow this to continue to happen. The penalty isn't tough.

Or he's just suspicious of prescription drugs -- some people are.

The option of deducting sales taxes is especially popular in Florida, Texas, Nevada, Washington and other states that don't have their own income tax.

In trying to resolve Chen's current situation, Beijing could lay the blame on local officials as a way to save face. In a similar fashion, when a village in southern China protesting against land seizures drove their local leaders out late last year, higher level authorities resolved the dispute by blaming village leaders they said had acted corruptly.

“Nobody enjoys running at full speed,” North Carolina guard and St. Patrick product Dexter Strickland said. “We feel like if we do that, we have an advantage.

Cyclists on this route will definitely want to be fortified as they approach Bixby Bridge, the marathon's halfway point, and Hurricane Point, a mile south of the landmark structure. Completed in 1932, the span made from a single concrete arch stands more than 260 feet high and extends more than 700 feet across the canyon and Bixby Creek; for marathoners heading north, the bridge is a reward for the grueling two-mile climb up and rapid mile-long descent down the point. For those of us not in a rush, both the bridge and the summit of Hurricane Point, which offers sweeping prospects on non-foggy days, make obvious photo ops.

Instructions: Remove beef from refrigerator at least 30 minutes before cooking. Rub with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Sear on all sides in a very hot skillet or on the grill, about 5 to 7 minutes total.

But it isn't enough. Krymov seems so enamored of his inventive stagings - most of which we've seen handled more creatively by other directors - that he lingers on effects long enough to make us wonder what purpose they serve. Meanwhile, the story goes begging in the streets of Paris, and a mere 80 minutes of theater seems a lot longer.

"It's abstinence-based, but realistic about what can come from unprotected sex," said Beth Horner, assistant superintendent of Columbia schools.

The glaring absence in both of those lines is the homers. Berkman has yet to hit his first homer of the season, but he's missed a couple weeks with injuries. Pujols has yet to hit his first home run as an Angel, but he's been dealing with the marine layer and that real oppressive fog of mega-contract expectations. Or his balance is off. Or whatever. Craig has the ability to change that number for the Cardinals.

But can it really be done at home? As daunting as it might seem to make your own infusion, Gaber, who has been making her own liqueurs since 2006, says it requires only a few steps. Lavender, rose, jasmine and any number of fruits will give vodka a lovely hint of their flavor; use dried flowers (which you can get from Whole Foods) for intense flavor, and let it sit for at least a week (refrigerate if you're using fruit).

Under the Ohio constitution, the attachment of the appropriation also means that the legislation becomes effective upon the expected signature of Republican Gov. John Kasich. That is an attempt to short-circuit a threatened referendum on the new congressional lines from the Ohio Democratic Party, which would now need a court ruling in its favor to start the referendum process.
The Tigers returned all but one player from last year's final four team, and all of those guys contribute one way or another. Luebke has to make sure he gets the ball to the right spot on the court but also to the right people. Spreading the wealth isn't as easy as Luebke makes it look. He said he tries to exploit an opponent's defensive weaknesses while feeding everyone a steady diet of opportunities.

"I met her just before she recorded it," Benson says. "I met her on the street near the Empire State Bulding. She got her hair done at the same place I took my boys.

Sure enough."

An hour later, Melchionna tried to butt in line again, Dollinger said. When Dellatacoma approached him, Melchionna threw his shoulder into the officer, Dollinger said.
When Apple launched the iPad two years ago, publishers saw two ways to balance Amazon.com's power: Enough readers would prefer Apple's shiny tablet over the Kindle to cut into Amazon's sales and the agency model would stabilize prices. Apple's iBookstore has yet to become a major force, but publishers believes the new price model has reduced Amazon's market share from around 90 percent to around 60 percent, with Barnes & Noble's Nook in second at 25 percent. The iBookstore is believed to have 10 percent to 15 percent.

If there is a connection between the timing of Mr. Johnson's arrest and the investigation into Mr. Nicholson, that's a real problem.

The law says there needs to be an "actual conflict," not just the appearance of one, he said, and in their view there was no conflict at all.

For a true home theater experience, don’t forget to invest in a pair (or a few pairs) of blackout curtains.

Add a cozy blanket, popcorn and soda to complete the experience.

Insurers issue such "force-placed" policies to homeowners who miss mortgage payments or allow their homeowners' policy to lapse.

As a young woman, Robin Azevedo never thought about taking over her family's business, the McRoskey Mattress Co. When her son entered preschool, she looked for a job that would fill two afternoons a week and was hired by her father. "With grown-up eyes, I got engaged in the business and what we did," Azevedo said. "My dad really had no exit strategy. It was that work ethic of, 'You just keep working till you drop dead.' After about 10 years, I approached my dad about taking over the business, and he was ecstatic."

The three of us were huddled on a Saturday morning inside Alfaro's warehouse with three uncorked bottles resting atop a stainless-steel storage drum. The midwinter sun ricocheted off Italian fermenters sitting outside the open doors. Several glasses into our tasting of "buttery" Chardonnays and "ashy" Pinots, Alfaro fired up his Kawasaki mule, an all-terrain vehicle, to give us a closer look at his vines. But first he adjusted his headband to keep his long, cool-dad hair from whipping him in the face. "This is our Pinot," he shouted over his shoulder as we charged over the crest of a hill and into a valley with rows of dormant vines. Alfaro cut the engine and dismounted next to a pile of vine shoots. It was the remnants of pruning season. "This whole area is perfect for Pinot because there are lots of warm days and cold nights," he said.

It's key that we all understand the origin of the movement <U+0096> and that the movement itself has grown into a more amorphous and uncontrolled version of that orchestrated start.

Lugar has been in the Senate since 1977. In his last election in 2006, Democrats didn't even field an opponent because of his perceived strong popularity.

Well, OK, you say, but Olbermann isn't really a journalist; he's a commentator. And that's true. Anyone who has listened to him for five minutes doesn't have a shred of doubt where he stands. He doesn't have any objectivity to compromise. But he does operate out of a newsroom, after all, and anchored the network's Election Night coverage. And it was interesting to learn that the policy he violated was not necessarily even that he donated money to a campaign, but that he didn't receive the blessing of his bosses before he did it. (In case you're wondering, conservative Fox TV news doesn't even have that caveat regarding political donations by its staff.)

Economic growth/job creation must be a major priority. I will work to develop a comprehensive economic vision that defines our county as a cohesive economic unit, counteracts fragmented growth by making collaboration among all municipalities a priority and supports equitable distribution of economic opportunity. (The vision will also include) identifying targeted industry clusters to support a proactive “go to market” strategy for business attraction. Targeted clusters include biomedicine/bioscience and arts/culture/tourism. As we promote and enhance tourism, every tourist dollar is an “imported” dollar, bringing taxes to the county and supporting thousands of service industry jobs, many of them in small businesses.

American discourse is the freest part of our society. It's what other people dream of as they fight for the democracy we take for granted and sometimes shame. I can't imagine what it's like to live in a country where you cannot say what you want. But just because you can doesn't mean you should.
Todd was taunted by numerous people who showed up for the morning general assembly -- a time when anyone can be heard -- for suggesting that Occupy Portland needed centralized leadership or to clarify its message and demands.

Google and YouTube seem to think so as well or they wouldn't be trying to negotiate contracts with major copyright owners.

"It's not so much the volume of snow that we've had. It's been that the timing of the storms has been perfect," Linde said. "They've all been good upslope storms when we benefit.

When you feel like you have gotten the short end of the stick, or a raw deal, trying to negotiate with a credit-card issuer is a bit like dealing with the Internal Revenue Service, only without the IRS' charm.

"This is your test of who is going to shut the door on somebody or give them an opportunity," Marquette coach John Meyer said. "You have to give Eureka credit, because they hung in there. I felt like we gave them too many opportunities. We gave them, in my opinion, nine freebies; too many walks, too many hit batters, too many errors. A number of those scored. That's the disappointing thing."

"When an appraisal comes in low, it puts doubt in the mind of the buyer as to the true value of that property," said Richard Kassouf, the broker-owner of New Hope Realty in Brunswick. "And it gives them a crisis that they have to deal with, where they have to come up with more money for the down payment to allow that transaction to be completed. Or they have to negotiate the price down."
Overall, U.S. light-vehicle sales averaged an annual rate of 14.6 million in the first quarter. At that pace, U.S. auto sales would finish 2012 with their highest total since 2007. At the beginning of 2012, many best-case scenarios had called for 14 million in sales this year. GM is expecting sales to top that level, Johnson said. Ford said it plans to update its sales forecast Wednesday, which currently calls for 13.3 million to 14.3 million light-vehicle sales.

Be likable: A tough assignment for some, that's for sure. But Cialdini's research has found that a little easygoing pleasantness can be just as persuasive as talent or actual ability. Perhaps unfairly, looks count too: A study of Canadian elections, for example, found that attractive candidates received more votes than their less-blessed opponents,, even though voters claimed they didn't care about appearances.
The nation's largest drugstore chain said its split with Express Scripts, a north St. Louis County-based pharmacy benefits manager, hurt results by about 7 cents per share in the quarter that ended Feb. 29. A mild cold and flu season also affected earnings by about 3 cents per share.

For the eggs: Pour water into a large shallow skillet to about 2-3 inches deep, and bring water to just below a simmer, with just a few bubbles breaking the surface. Carefully crack the eggs into the water and poach about 4 minutes for an egg with a creamy, runny yolk and fully cooked white.

The Beavers can do better. Riley must know it. I'm surprised his wife and daughter didn't beat me to the message here with a, "We love you, but you can't do this," over dinner. And maybe the coach will wake up sometime before kickoff and realize that he needs to put the program, and the community, and what's best for Masaniai in front of Saturday's short-term goal.

It was an awful tragedy, but I hoped it would take me off the hook for an interview that I didn't want to do that Tuesday morning.
Barr suggested that officials plan to overhaul the Freddie Mac/Fannie Mae model and the dominance they had over the mortgage market under the guise of the government's blessing. Freddie and Fannie buy mortgages from banks, but their risky practices led the government to take them over to save them from collapse in September 2008.
“Bruce, I think it’s all these re-operations that make you prematurely gray,” says cardiothoracic anesthesiologist Colleen Koch, who has been part of his team for 20 years.
Speaking of knuckleheads, the Mavericks will not go back-to-back. Dallas acquired Vince Carter in the off-season, and I once again must cite The Vince Carter Rule: No team he plays on will ever win an NBA title. Fans sometimes forget his nickname, “Half-Man/Half-Amazing/Half-Baked.” The Mavs are Carter’s fifth team in 14 seasons; he could play for all 30 NBA teams over 50 seasons and still not win a league title.
"There are so many factors at work here, and it's not easy to estimate precisely. I wouldn't advise that you expect any upward revision" in power-supply capacity, said Hirofumi Kawachi, an energy-industry senior analyst at Mizuho Investors Securities.

Who will like it? Girls' night outers, your book club, Grandma, first dates, 13-year-old birthday partiers — it covers some ground. Service is lively and fresh-faced, a little saucy and willing to kibbitz. A phalanx of food bussers move the goods (but, alas, hold plates aloft and wait for diners to claim ownership) and management trolls the dining room like so many well-dressed sharks.
Roberts concludes "Pavane" with a somewhat problematic coda, one that compels the reader to think again about the action of the novel and of the church's role in it. He also suggests that history is governed by a kind of eternal recurrence, that once before, "beyond all the memories of men, there was a great civilization" that rose and flourished until there came "a burning, an Armageddon."
But that officer “wasn’t able to do so because he was in the midst of an emergency call,” Essex County Acting Prosecutor Robert Laurino said Sunday afternoon in a press conference about the shooting.

After all, he was a geologist, not a bankruptcy attorney. And he hardly was a political juggernaut. He'd lost three races for Congress, a race for Vanderburgh County Council and a GOP convention fight for secretary of state.

According to recent Wisconsin polls, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett leads former Dane County executive Kathleen Falk in the race to run as Democratic candidate for governor in a historic recall election.

"This guy is so out of touch and so partisan, it wouldn’t have mattered what I would have said, he would have attacked.

I complained when the sweet but conventional "In the Heights" beat out the astringently fresh "Passing Strange" in 2008 and when the Lee Hall- Elton John juggernaut "Billy Elliot" upstaged the far more dramatically daring "Next to Normal" in 2009. This year, let me reverse course and congratulate Tony voters for their dogged consistency. In a world that has become violently unpredictable, "Broadway's biggest night" never fails to live up to its staid reputation — so what if it poisons the creative well for the next decade.

In truth, if they had their way we'd be back in the late 19th century -- before the federal income tax, antitrust laws, the Pure Food and Drug Act, and the Federal Reserve. A time when robber barons -- railroad, financial and oil titans -- ran the country. A time of wrenching squalor for the many and mind-numbing wealth for the few.
A Suffolk University survey taken Saturday and Sunday shows Brown with double-digit leads in three communities the poll identified as bellwethers: Gardner, Fitchburg and Peabody. But internal statewide polls for both sides show a dead-heat.

A person need not read much of "Moral Sentiments" to see exactly what Smith thought of self-interest and other-regarding behavior. In fact, a person does not have to read a whole chapter, or a whole page. A person need read only the first sentence: "How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortunes of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it, except the pleasure of seeing it."

Prices for longer-term Treasurys fell, as investors felt less need to put their money in investments considered safe. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.27 percent from 2.11 percent late Wednesday. A bond's yield rises when its price falls.
NOAA said the National Weather Service was well prepared and that its collaboration with emergency management agencies and the public did save lives.
Two physical realities constrain progress on this front. First, manned spacecraft are heavy. Humans venturing into space must take food, water, other consumables, life-support equipment, medical and safety equipment, and fuel and hardware to return them to Earth. Also, any launch vehicle carrying people into space has to be subjected to quality controls far higher than those imposed on unmanned spacecraft, further driving up costs.

In 2001, just days after 9/11, Kobach got a job as chief adviser on immigration law and border security to John Ashcroft, who was in his first year as U.S. attorney general.

President Obama has pledged to begin the withdrawal of American troops in July 2011 and to complete the transition to Afghan-led forces by the end of 2014. Most observers predict that the first troop reduction will be little more than a token gesture. That moves the debate to whether maintaining a major troop presence in Afghanistan for an additional two and a half years can achieve our stated goals and, even if it can, whether it is worth the additional cost in American lives and treasure.

Nor should equal justice for everyone be an issue subject to the usual political horse-trading and back-scratching that goes on in Annapolis. This is different from a simple "vote for the road project in my district, and I'll vote for yours" sort of transaction. The gay marriage issue goes to the heart of values that both advocates and opponents consider fundamental, and it shouldn't be an excuse for lawmakers to swap their votes and their principles to advance ancillary causes, no matter how worthy.
The future position for Murphy, Alderson said, will depend on how the team fills holes during the offseason.
Lloyd: I don’t know if the rest world will ever catch up to me because I don’t know where the hell I am most the time. If you notice, almost every TV commercial lately has ukulele in it. The ukulele is now being taken more seriously. It’s not a just novelty instrument or a1920’s nostalgia trip, but an important member of the string family used in classical, jazz, folk, rock, etc. I like Tiny Tim but enough of the “Tiptoe Through the Tulip” requests. That’s like a guitarist getting, “Dude, play Freebird!” (which I get as well). But it’s no surprise to me that more people are getting turned on to the pure sound of the ukulele. That’s why I love it so much - it has a weak sound but in the right hands it can sound powerful. I think because rock music relied so heavily on the guitar, you figure at some point it may have been stretched to the limit. But making folk or orchestra instruments as lead rock instruments could have endless possibilities in that genre. I hope to hear more in the future.

NEW YORK — Curtis Granderson felt like something just wasn’t right. For whatever reason, his timing at the plate had just been off this season. So before he took the field against the Minnesota Twins Thursday night, he took some extra batting practice with hitting coach Kevin Long standing behind him offering a yay or nay for each hack.
That's not quite true, but it's too close for comfort. Sometimes the paper's endorsements were enthusiastic; sometimes they were made only because the trio's opponents were weak. Here's the tally:
Interim GM Chad Buchanan and team salary cap specialist Joe Cronin met with Batum’s agent, Bouna Ndiaye, Friday morning in a negotiating session that Ndiaye described as “a long, interesting meeting.” The sides exchanged contract figures for the first time, but could not reach an agreement and it does not appear a deal is imminent.

There's some idea that maybe a few more tough games, win or lose, might be doing the Buckeyes well at this point in the season. Last season, it was often easy. This season, Matta pointed to the last-second wins at Northwestern and at Michigan State in the final week of the regular season that were required to get Ohio State a share of the Big Ten title.

"Building fences and stopping people from sneaking into the country only goes part way," said Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer at the center who studies the undocumented population. Passel said 35 million people come to the U.S. with visas every year for extended stays.

Henri Dutilleux's Second Symphony, the other major piece on the program, also used the concerto grosso format, but in large scale, with a 12-piece chamber ensemble fronting a very full orchestra. With harpsichord, celeste and timpani among the soloists, the sonorities were captivating in their variety, and the kaleidoscopic transformations of instrumental color both among the soloists and between solo group and orchestra were captivating, thanks in no small part to the meticulous attention of conductor Gregory Vajda. For a piece the symphony has never played in the 50 years since its composition, it sounded extremely well rehearsed, with clean attacks, even momentum through tricky rhythms, and vividly realized textures.

WAN YANHAI: Wan founded a prominent AIDS advocacy group in China but fled to the U.S. in 2010, leaving during a business trip to Hong Kong with his wife and child. Tighter regulations on overseas donations to Chinese aid groups had hurt his work, and he said he received dozens of phone calls from police in a single day shortly before he fled. In the past, the former Health Ministry official had been detained for up to weeks at a time for advocacy work that included publicizing an AIDS scandal among poor villagers in the 1990s.

He earned one of the final spots in the bullpen Wednesday after a spring in which he overcame a groin injury to allow just one earned run in six spring innings (a 1.50 ERA). His sidearm delivery has been tough on both righties and lefties over the course of his career, and he allowed just one hit in three innings against lefties this spring.

The activities kick off May 27 with a festival celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Golden Gate Bridge. The bash, which culminates with a fireworks show, will be held along the 4-mile stretch from Fort Point to Pier 39. Because the event is free, officials say there is no way to gauge how many people might attend. Mary Currie, a bridge spokeswoman, said the expectation is that thousands will participate from all over the country. But the hope is that because the waterfront is spread out, there will be some breathing room.

I admire the passion of the protesters, but when defenseless children in this community are suffering and dying violent deaths and legions of Cleveland children are denied a quality education, I can only wonder how to tap the zealotry of animal lovers for more pressing causes.
On other disagreements, most notably their desire to add a dozen employees to the public- assistance and children's services departments, it's County Council members who need to rethink.

Unlike the more common osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease - the body attacks the lining of a joint as if it were trying to protect it from injury or disease. The lining becomes inflamed and fluid builds up in the joints, resulting in pain, swelling and stiffness that may affect many different joints at the same time. Usually at least two or three different joints are involved on both sides of the body, often in a mirror-image pattern.

SIGHTSEEING. Commercial sightseeing excursions tend to be overpriced -- and they almost always make irritatingly long stops at souvenir shops chosen because of the kickbacks they give the tour company or tour guide. Moreover, a tour's pace is always dictated by the slowest member of the group -- and that can be agonizingly slow. Better alternatives:

A: The biggest thing we learned is just how often they are actually in contact with people. They are swimming amongst them all the time in this area, yet there are very few shark attacks. Sadly we also learned that there is a very active sport fishery off the beaches in this area for these sharks, so the sharks once again have far more to fear from us than we do of them.
What happened: Firms including Standard & Poor's and Moody's rate bonds to help investors analyze the risk and return trade-off. Critics say the rating agencies masked the crisis by giving inflated grades to mortgage-backed securities underpinned by subprime loans. Critics also contend the rating agencies harbored actual or perceived conflicts of interest, because the investment banks that packaged those securities for sale to investors are the ones who paid for the ratings. Of note, the diversification created by linking dozens of mortgages to a given security didn't help lessen risk as expected.

My 13-year-old son has heard so many anti-texting sermons that when I was recently touting Clint Eastwood's performance as a take-the-law-in-his-own-hands cop in "Dirty Harry," hoping he'd want to watch the film, my kid immediately asked, "Does he shoot people for texting in movie theaters too?"

Five pastas are equally well executed. Pici ($15), thick, doughy noodles, have a bit of elasticity and enough substance to stand up to a fine dice of pigeon livers balanced with fresh sage and sweet bursts of peas. Wild nettles find a home in many pasta dishes, too; one night the distinctive greens were paired with Gorgonzola dolce latte and lonza, a cured pork loin ($15); another night they were mixed with sunchokes roasted in embers and flavored with bottarga, cured fish roe ($15.50).
GOP legislators would argue that HB 1617 would result in a tax increase. And a party that won't increase the nation's lowest state tax on cigarettes (to the detriment of individuals' health and the state's Medicaid budget) or collect taxes on online sales by out-of-state businesses (to the detriment of Missouri retailers) is not going to mess with any kind of tax increase whatsoever.

According to the league, Saints defensive captain Vilma offered $10,000 in cash to any player who knocked then-Cardinals QB Warner out of a playoff game at the end of the 2009 season, and the same amount for knocking then-Vikings QB Favre out of that season<U+0092>s NFC championship game. The Saints were flagged for roughing Favre twice in that game, and the league later said they should have received another penalty for a brutal high-low hit from Remi Ayodele and Bobby McCray that hurt Favre<U+0092>s ankle. He was able to finish the game, but the Saints won in overtime en route to the NFL title.
It's gorgeous to look at, but a little incongruous, given the rest of the artist's career. So it makes sense to follow the example of Val Espinoza, a fellow tourist I met on the steps beneath Rivera's allegory. Espinoza and his wife, Rosa, had come from Fresno just to look at Rivera murals, and this was one of three stops for them. (I'll have to check out these two others on my next trip.)

"True Blood" (9 p.m. Sunday, HBO): One thing you have to say about executive producer Alan Ball's supernatural cable drama -- it's rarely in danger of repeating itself. Each plot-packed season has its distinct themes and emotional shadings.

Bill (Stephen Moyer) was captured. And the eerie battle is brewing into a war.

That's right, the slot I had roughly estimated the Giants to move into is occupied by the team responsible for two of their extra picks this year: No. 45 overall (second round) and No. 151 overall (fifth round) -- the bounty in last year's Jeremy Shockey trade. And better yet, that same team is also lacking picks in the third and sixth rounds because of trades with the Jets and Packers. The Saints have only their first-round pick, two fourths and a seventh. Not good for a team that could really use extra picks to continue to build around their core of players.
He said about 70 locals participated Friday morning and that most resumed trading by about noon because they had financial positions to close out before the day's pit session ended.

At least one council member supported the idea of a disinterested third party coming in and evaluating the township’s needs, so the township can seek bids on the project.
“We’re very excited about adding what Jamal can bring to this team. Obviously (he’s) a proven scorer coming off the bench throughout his NBA career. He’s had a terrific couple of years down in Atlanta. And we feel like he can be a real spark plug for us coming off our bench. And (coach) Nate (McMillan) is excited to have him. A lot of our players have relationships with Jamal and are excited to have him.

This story line was based on a strike by Polish factory workers in December 1970, says Hinc, in which the government-controlled Army and civilian police force opened fire on workers as they returned to their factories. Decades passed before Poles could accept what really happened, that it was Polish soldiers who killed their countrymen.
But there were no complaints from the divers once they arrived in Tijuana and set eyes on the facility. It rivals (and probably surpasses) anything north of the border, with eight 1-meter boards, four 3-meter boards and a world-class diving tower that, unlike most facilities in the States, has platform wide enough to accommodate the relatively new discipline of synchronized diving.

"He fits good at No. 2 because he's got some juice," Acta said.

"Farmers grow locally, and artist participation is considered by a juried panel. The O'Fallon Farmers and Artists Market is not a flea market. Rather, it provides an outlet for our community to easily purchase from area growers and support local economy. We are a nonprofit organization that is not funded by tax dollars. Rather, it was started by a group of citizens in the community. The market invites involvement from community organizations and provides an avenue for education," Glidden said.

Wolfe tells his patients to drink a glass of milk about 20 minutes before taking the drugs first thing in the morning, because the protein and calcium will stimulate acid production, and the drugs works best after you've been fasting overnight. If you can't drink milk, try coffee. The caffeine stimulates acid production, too. While it's best to drink the coffee or milk before taking the medication, you can also take the drugs with the beverages, if need be, he says.

"His arm speed is unbelievable," Orioles pitching coach Rick Adair said of Wada's change-up. "He's got great arm action and can throw it for strikes, throw it for a chase. He knew what he was doing.

Still, he contends, certain emotional styles make it harder to lead a meaningful, productive life. Which inspires both the bad news and the good news from the book. A person who is self-opaque in the self-awareness department, puzzled in the social intuition department and unfocused in the attention department will likely struggle at dinner parties. (Bad news.) But, according to Davidson's findings, the brain is malleable enough to kick your scores up or down each spectrum a few notches, paving the way for future social success. (Good news!)

All in all <U+0096> a very entertaining day. You had outstanding pitching from both Verlander and Jon Lester. You had two of the power teams in the AL going at it. And you got a Tiger win.

It reached a pitch last week at the Verdi Club in San Francisco's Mission District, where a sold-out crowd of 300 people greeted Strayed's unveiling as Sugar with a standing ovation. She was preceded onstage by musicians, a comedian and seven "women of The Rumpus" who wore fishnet stockings and orange gloves with "Hell's" on one hand and "Bells" on the other. They read questions and answers from columns by Steve Almond, who originated the "Dear Sugar" column in The Rumpus before passing it on to Strayed. Almond wrote "Dear Sugar" in the persona of a woman who had been around the block a few times and wasn't above a snarky response. Strayed, he says, took a more nurturing approach and turned the sometimes-reflexive hostility of the Web into a community of supporters.

Though corn and beans are better-known Mexican natives, squash predates them by several thousand years; Maya people domesticated several varieties of squash as early as 8000 B.C. Oils from these seeds were the main source of dietary fat before the Spanish introduced beef and pork.

Toasted, ground pumpkin seeds still appear on menus even more than the flesh.

Executing prisoners who "volunteer" by declining appeals is actually good policy. Prisoners, properly advised, may competently choose not to exercise constitutional rights. They have not "volunteered" for the death penalty, that decision was made by a judge and a jury, based on evidence in a courtroom. In a state where we allow competent patients to choose physician-assisted death, and where we allow citizens to decline life support when facing terminal illnesses, how can we decline similar autonomy to prisoners? The governor is concerned that the system is expensive. But that is the cost of protecting the public interest in assuring publicly provided safeguards. And whether that expense is justified arguably needs to be viewed through the eyes of the victims' families. Perhaps, as well, we might measure cost by comparison to a state retirement system that pays a football coach $500,000 per year.

When Seabury pitched the cookbook idea to Dan Lorenzo, the Ramsey-based guitarist with the ‘80s thrash metal band Hades (with a reunion show next month in Clifton) and the ‘90s grunge band Non Fiction, Lorenzo knew it would be a hit (and indeed, Seabury is already planning a sequel.)

"The Kid With a Bike" is another empathetic film by Jean- Pierre and Luc Dardenne, the brothers from Belgium who have strong sympathy for alienated children and young people, and who avoid melodrama and sensation in telling their stories so movingly. There are two things that could go seriously wrong in young Cyril's life, but they don't quite happen. The Dardennes don't wring us out like that. They prefer the drama of ordinary life, in which for a boy like Cyril things don't easily go right. In straightforward, realistic scenes, they show a boy who fears he has been thrown away, but persists in feeling that his father only lost him and will be happy to find him again.

A small group of foreclosure specialists, all of whom work at the same location, process a nominal number of foreclosures a day -- not 8,000 like the big banks. Comfortable with its processes and has no reason to change them or to suspend the foreclosures already filed with the courts.
After the opening scene, a few terrifically shot moments with a convict escaping, maw first, from a lawnmower bag, the film scoots over to a married couple sprawled in their bed in Jersey Village, Texas. Abe (John Diehl) and Linda (Rachael Harris) are clearly aroused, but only Linda is eager for a little morning sunshine. Abe won't have anything to do with her, carnally speaking, because she's barren - "and God said to Onan: 'Thou shalt not spill thy seed in vain.' "

Yesterday, the Marlins slapped a five-game suspension on their manager and Guillen traveled to Miami for a press conference.
Palma was aware of that history, which only added to his excitement.
Lange, 42, grew up in Union and now lives in Hoboken. He’s a former “Mad TV” regular and has acted in movies like “Dirty Work” and “Old School,” but his career took a quantum leap when he joined the cast of Howard Stern’s radio show in 2001. His quick wit and sordid tales of substance abuse and dating disasters have become an essential part of the mix.
He hooked his tee shot well left of the tree line, and his recovery shot did not reach the fairway. His third shot was a grounder off the pine straw, and he slammed his club after that. His fourth was a pitching wedge from 136 yards that sailed over the green. No. 5 was a chip that didn't reach the green. He putted downhill to four feet, burned the right edge and knocked in a two-footer for eight.

Park Cafe, St. Mary, MT: “Pie for strength” is the motto here, and we couldn’t put it any better. Because, let’s face it, even the most idyllic of summer roadtrips have their stresses. The wrong turn, the misread map, the must-see natural wonder inexplicably closed for the season. In those perilous why-did-we-go-on-this-vacation-and-by-the-way-why-am-I-married-to-you moments, what can make things magically all right? Pie—warm, sweet fruit spilling out of tender crust. Pie—chocolate cream with a cumulus cloud of whipped cream floating above. Pie, pie, pie. 3147 U.S. 89 W.; 406/732-4482.

“I’d probably be wondering, too,” Costa said Tuesday afternoon. “But I worked under a number of great coaches – Mike Bellotti, Chip Kelly, Mark Helfrich, Gary Crowton... I was known to be cerebral, very coachable, and I’m really hoping to share some of that knowledge to help kids get better.”
"Last year during the Sweet 16 we couldn't finish down the stretch," senior William Buford said of Ohio State's 62-60 loss to Kentucky. "We've got to do that this year. I think we have a chance."
So yeah, here comes Jeff Tedford this week. A guy Ducks fans once viewed fondly as the heir to the Oregon empire. He was Chip Kelly before anyone knew there was a Chip Kelly. And even as Tedford's team stinks this season, I suspect if the Ducks decide to nap in Berkeley for a half, he'll arm his team with pillows and instruct the Bears to smother Oregon's season.
The fight against the devastating disease has progressed slowly because it is so poorly understood.
Councilman Dale Miller, a former state legislator who also got a call from the engineers' association, said he doesn't agree with the group's view.

Such projects may be the group's great dilemma. State officials believe optional toll lanes are among the best tools to offer regional congestion relief, serving exactly the function the regional referendum was meant to provide. By charging a toll that rises with congestion, they keep out people who can't afford it, thus creating one thing that does not currently exist in metro Atlanta: the choice of a reliably congestion-free lane, spanning a long distance.

Other announced performers: DJ Khaled, whose "All I Do Is Win" was an unoffical Summer Jam anthem two years ago, witty Wale, who has lately transformed himself from an underground favorite to a mainstream hitmaker, the pugnacious Maino, the diminished but still relevant Young Jeezy, and bubbling-under Meek Mill, who stands a decent chance of following his mentor Rick Ro$$ to mainstream recognition. There'll be some (relatively) fresh faces, too: the affable Big Sean, Jay-Z protege J. Cole, quick-rhyming Young Money emcee Tyga, French Montana, Mavado, and 2 Chainz, who features prominently on "Beez in the Trap," Nicki Minaj's latest hit.

A: Arborist McMahon, who is also Desert Botanical Garden's resident cactus expert, says that smaller saguaros can still be rather tender in the full sun in the summer here. He suggests that the plant's terminal received too much light this summer and the tissue was burned. Usually, the plant will form a new bud at the top and resume growing. You should put a small piece of 50 percent shade cloth over the top next summer to protect the growing tip. Do not try to remove any dead tissue. Just let it resume growth on its own. You may not see any activity until next spring or summer, so be patient.
The company said today it filed for approval of Xarelto as a treatment for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and as a preventative treatment for recurring venous thromboembolism.

To be clear, I don't object to Disney on moral grounds. I love Disneyland and have been a season passholder for years. We even spent last Mother's Day at the Disneyland Hotel. That may be part of the reason my family and I were so disappointed by Disney World: We're spoiled. We live in Southern California with theme parks, world-class zoos, Seaworld and even a wild animal park all within driving distance. And certainly the encyclopedic travel guides and websites devoted to Disney World are proof enough that people are besotted with the place.
"Yesterday was a heartbreaker," GO! President Nancy Lieberman said. "We live for race day, so we really felt their pain.

Jackie made the Olympic trials and had a great race there, then decides to run with us. It's gratifying."
"The role we have for David is to outplay them, not just check them. We need Backes' line to do things offensively that are strong and determined.

And they've done a great job of that so far."

What it doesn't mean is having a sparse garden that is nothing but sticks in the summer, Tiede says.
The film's enduring value, though, lies in what it has to say -- never didactically, always inferentially -- about the power of art, the strength and fragility of artists (one scene in a cafe, involving Christa and a hitherto secret admirer, is as heartbreaking as it is breathtaking), and what it means to be human.
"It all really started with the house," says Robinson.

"If you're going to take your religion seriously, you should feel it's superior to others. Why else believe in it?" said Alan Wolfe, director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College.

While at the function a fight broke out NOT involving Mr. Marshall or his friends. While attempting to leave to avoid the melee Mrs. Marshall was struck in the face by a thrown bottle. She suffered serious injury. While attempting to leave and take his wife to the hospital, the mayhem continued outside. Finally Mr. Marshall was able to take his wife to the hospital where she was treated for serious injuries. Mr. Marshall is hoping to assist authorities in regards to this matter."

With the 20th century came the introduction of electronic instruments, even now regarded by many as an unacceptable intrusion.

"If a parent thinks football is too dangerous I can't try to convince them it's not," Mesa Desert Ridge coach Jeremy Hathcock said. "It's a dangerous sport, no question about it. But at the high school level, I don't think you're going to have that propensity to have brain mush."

“Clearly, we're seeing some moderation in the economy,” Culp said. “We all read the headlines. It certainly is prudent at any time in the (business) cycle.

Kevin Rogers of the Arizona Farm Bureau put it this way: "My industry and others need legal access to labor pools that are seasonal, short- and long-term. These pools will not be sourced from this country. This is an essential fact. You can tell me to pay more, to use convicts, to hire more students, and you can tell me technology will solve my problems. ... You can presume to tell me my business. ... It won't change the essential fact of a need for immigrant labor in Arizona and the rest of the country."

Amy Kaiser's chorus was well-prepared but sounded both ponderous and surprisingly underpowered most of the time. The soprano section was generally weak, and the chorus rarely projected a sense of the meaning of the texts.
Collapsing in the face of a Kings rush, the Blues allowed Jeff Carter to follow his initial shot into the slot area and lift the loose puck over Elliott's shoulder for the third goal.

Kevin Parrom, still recovering from a bullet wound in his leg, is similar in size (6-6) and toughness.

Police withheld the name of the victim and other information about the fire, pending notification of next of kin.
If you manage to keep alive a houseplant for, oh, more than a few months, there will surely come the day when it has outgrown its starter pot. The roots will be tangled. It will be gasping for air. It is especially wise to check in on your potted plants at winter's end (especially in certain climes), when the promise of vernal sun brings on hardy growth spurts, and your ready-to-burst houseplant begs for roomier real estate. (Some signs of a houseplant in need of roomier digs: It's top-heavy for the pot, or when roots start emerging from the existing pot's drainage holes.)

He's not too bad for being the Timberwolves' third-favorite point guard in the 2009 draft. Actually, Minnesota didn't even want him — or keep him. After selecting back-to-back point guards — Ricky Rubio and Jonny Flynn — at No. 5 and 6 overall in the first round, the Wolves used the 18th selection for Lawson, then immediately dealt him to the Nuggets. Rubio didn't even play for the Timberwolves until this season, preferring to stay in Spain. After an impressive NBA debut, Rubio tore an ACL in a collision with Bryant on March 9.

In regard to "Envisioning I-70 as a toll road" (Jan 18), I was troubled by the cost of the toll road to motorists. Ten to fifteen cents per mile is insane. Even more troubling is the tripling of the cost to our trucking companies. Did the Missouri Department of Transportation take into consideration the amount of students who travel back and forth to the several universities on the I-70 corridor between St. Louis and Kansas City? As the parent of a student at the University of Missouri in Columbia, I know my child does not have the means to pay $30.00 every time he makes a 200 mile round trip from our home in St. Charles to the university. Did the Transportation Dept. take into consideration the cost to the small towns along this route who will ultimately suffer if this toll road comes to fruition? Motorists will not be able to afford the extra cost of visiting these small communities that depend on consumers for their livelihood. Towns, such as Hermann and Fulton, who depend on the tourism trade will be adversely affected. The overall cost to these communities, as well as the state itself, will be enormous. Motorists from our state, as well as others, might decide the cost of the toll roads far outweigh the desire to visit our state for the many amenities we provide. The Lake of the Ozarks and all of the towns along the way will lose many tourists to other recreational sites in other states. Carlyle Lake in Illinois and Rend Lake in Kentucky come to mind as areas that are in close proximity to the St. Louis area and offer many of the same recreational amenities that are available at the Lake of the Ozarks.

Ignoring caution, my husband, Greg, and I decided to return to the islands, our first visit in 10 years. We were drawn by the Savusavu Music Festival, an annual event that brings in music groups from all over the South Pacific, and we were celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary. And then there is the small thrill we derive from ignoring travel warnings -- unless artillery is involved. It wasn't.

No, seriously, that’s what he called himself in a YouTube video he posted on Tuesday when he said the resident Giant back flipper Jason Pierre-Paul is a “great athlete but I’m one, too.” Wilson then proceeded to beat Pierre-Paul’s back-flip count by a touchdown’s worth, 21-14.

But Obama's bill faces a troubled path in Congress, as Republicans strongly oppose its plans for tax increases on the wealthy and other spending provisions. Should the bill fail, Democrats are sure to remind jobless voters that the GOP blocked an attempt to redress discrimination against them at a time when work is so hard to find.
The Irish government protests it doesn't need aid, at least not yet, because it has sufficient funds through mid-2011 and is planning euro6 billion ($8 billion) in 2011 cuts and tax hikes. However, it has suggested that direct EU aid to its cash-strapped banks would boost Ireland's creditworthiness, since the government has guaranteed the banks' financial obligations.

The kufta kebabs ($12.95) are also redolent of mint, which, with a judicious amount of salt, spices and smoke from the grill, make the ground beef patties very satisfying. They arrive with a generous spread of sides: homemade bread, thick-cut fries and two salads that are also available a la carte. Zaalouk is a chunky eggplant and tomato mixture with a melty texture similar to caponata, and shalada has a tomato and parsley brightness similar to tabbouleh, without the bulgur.

But he was able to get his feet in there for an amazing 38-yard catch. The play was reviewed, but confirmed. The Giants are now at midfield.
Casa de Mi Padre is at its best (a relative term, mind you) when it's at its silliest and most surreal: the appearance of a mystical white mountain lion, who offers Ferrell's Armando sage counsel - and who is one of the least convincing animatronic puppets to come down the pike since comedian Soupy Sales conversed with White Fang - provides sublime guffaws. So, too, does a trippy dream sequence, with dolls, puppets, strobes, and a David Lynchian tableau.
The problem is that mail volume is shrinking rapidly. People don't need the Post Office when they can e-mail their friends and pay bills online. Postal officials estimate that they'll handle just 150 billion pieces in 2020, down from 177 billion last year and 213 billion in 2006.

Several observers said that in meetings, Wu would wander off onto subjects that grabbed his fancy. But Tippens made sure to follow up on whatever concerns a visitor had. Separately, three sources jokingly used the same phrase in saying that she worked for him for so long because she had Stockholm syndrome, a reference to the sympathy victims can feel for their captors. Among political insiders, it was a sign that something significant was up when Tippens joined five other staffers in leaving after the last election.

Close MacDill Air Force Base. We now move on to some Tampa pork. This air base should have been shut down years ago. It is poorly situated in a dense urban area, next to major civilian airports. But local congressional support and heavy lobbying have kept it open.

Nike was rolling out its new, overpriced, Third World-made status symbols, and for these sin-ugly psychedelic babies, at $220 plus tax, Nike again kept the prices ridiculously high and the supply extremely limited. Yet again, Nike would cause both a buzz and a feeding frenzy among those who would regard procurement of a pair of cheaply made sneakers as worthy of committing mayhem — and too many times even murder.
<U+0095> Next season: It will be easier to establish a rotation after a full offseason and training camp. And he'll have to figure out how to improve the defense after another down year at that end of the court.

What's worse, the new law created a system that wrongly will suck even more cash from Lake taxpayers once thousands more people become eligible for Medicaid in 2014 under new health-care regulations.
Yes, council over the years has been frustrated by actions of the board. But they recognized the potential dangers inherent in an elected school board. Despite that frustration, and despite the fact that the county council had little influence on who is appointed to the board, they all felt the solution of an elected board would be worse. Most of my colleagues think an elected board would be acceptable — if that board had the responsibility of raising the revenue and defending tax rates to voters.

Cha moved from Anaheim to Fullerton in 1995. Over the years, he's decided not to dwell on what's not coming back.

But at the time, they had no idea they would come to be known as a "Million Dollar Quartet."

What both groups fail to mention is that the fishing program is funded entirely by hunting and fishing fees, which don't come from taxes and aren't legally allowed to be used for anything other than hunting and fishing programs.

-- Hotels. Some good deals are already available, but major hotel chains seem to be following the airlines' lead in mounting short-fuse promotions. Currently, for example, Hyatt's promotion with AAA/AARP expires in early September, and Accor's current promotion also focuses on summer travel. As with airfares, I suggest you wait for a good promotion. As usual, however, you'll find your very best hotel prices through the flash sale websites (for really upscale spots) and through Hotwire and Priceline. On the other hand, it's never too early to book a vacation rental. Although prices can be highly seasonal, rates for the year are set and published far in advance and vacation rentals seldom run any short-term promotions. The earlier you buy the wider choice you have.

Dee didn't invent the system, says Duncan Steel, an astronomer at the Australian Centre for Astrobiology and author of a book about calendar history. A variant of the system remains in use in Iran today, a millennium after Persians first used one like it.
The buzz of chainsaws attempting to cut down the trees on Monday morning drowned out the loud squawking of the parrots that typically floods over Telegraph Hill -- that is, until Mark Bittner, who lives next door and who wrote the book about the birds and starred in a documentary with them, ran out of his cottage, stood at the base of the trees in protest and persuaded workers to turn off their saws.

Imagine what you and I could do with one day in which we didn't have to bind ourselves to a numbered date, one day with no prescribed obligations, no appointments, no work, no boss, no meetings, no mail, no media programming. That day would be a get-out-of-jail-free card, a day with a blank slate, a day of unordered possibilities, a day wiped clean.

But true to his namesake — the legendary New York City rapper Rakim — Rocky is clear in his goals to define a generation of that city's rap. And part of that is to leave much of the genre's cultural baggage behind. Rocky — who is straight — has been outspoken in his criticism of homophobia in hip-hop, and his braggadocio has an Oscar Wilde-ish touch (he calls himself "pretty" in lyrics).

The problem in both these instances is that reasonable analysis of what the demonstrators are actually saying doesn't support the pundits' talking-point takedowns. So regardless of how many times I might hear those pleas, I don't think it's the right choice for me to treat them as a topic of serious discussion.
Buying the Padres should be simpler, but it is bound to be expensive. Peter O'Malley has the name. His odds will improve if he also has the money.

_ "Alien" (1979): This belongs at the top of about five different lists, including best thriller and best horror film, as well. Ridley Scott did so many things right here — from the grimy, lived-in world of the Nostromo mixed with H.R. Giger's eerily seductive design to the perfect cast and Sigourney Weaver's bad-ass performance. I also love the way Scott keeps the alien unseen for so much of the gut-churning build up, then delivers one of the most terrifying creatures ever seen on screen. I still can't watch this one after about 8 p.m.

The latest episode is the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) mandate to restrict religious freedom in the name of mandated so-called health-care provisions. It is attempting to redefine what a religion may or may not hold as a right. The mandated provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (under the HHS’ interpretation) require Catholics and followers of other religions to act against their consciences and religious beliefs.

After a rough childhood, Mfume decided to change his life, graduating magna cum laude from Morgan State University and earning a master's degree from John Hopkins University. Born Frizzell Gray, he legally changed his name to Kweisi Mfume, meaning "Conquering Son of Kings" in the early 70s. Mfume was elected to the Baltimore City Council in 1978, and served seven terms in the U.S. House. In 1996, Mfume left Congress to accept the presidency of the NAACP, and now consults for the organization.

His opinion is entitled to change, but if Booker is labeling Vanderbeek “one of the most despicable owners” in the NHL, we’ll just assume he’s too busy tweeting to keep up with the league.

What stuck out the most was the play of quarterback Keith Price. He won't be 100 percent for the Alamo Bowl --- it's best to realize now that likely won't happen until he has some rest and real time to heal after the season (and maybe a little procedure along the way). But he looked great throwing the ball and running around a little better than he has most of the season.

muckduck: The Ducks can now begin their dominance as an official ELITE team with that 2012 Rose Bowl win and DAT is going to be a HUGE part of this unreal offense next year!!! Samurai7: Besides the two long runs for touchdowns untouched, DAT picked up a key first down beating a defender well short of the first down marker, which set up the winning touchdown. Also, He and Barner were the "gunners" on the punt with 22 seconds left going downfield making the fair catch necessary and creating a long field! hermtownhomy: DAT definitely stood out, but that does not mean he should be singled out as the only reason they won. He is scary fast. Probably the fastest player in football right now and we all look forward to the future with him, but his two runs were not necessarily turning points in the game. They still could have gone on to score if those two runs hadn't happened. True turning points in the game were the interception and fumble recovery. I just don't agree with JC's point here that DAT was the reason they won. It was a team effort. RipCityDroHead85: De'Ant was prolly the MVP, I'd agree, but LaMike and Darren had pretty good games too, along with Tuinei. As far as that best duck ever, I don't know if i'd be heaping that much praise on him just yet, LaMike made a key block that sprung one of his long ones. No mention of the best duck rb ever out there blocking for another rb. portlandchiro1: I agree with the praise heaped on De'Anthony, but lets not get carried away. This was a full team win with many stars contributing. Where would Oregon have been without the two forced turnovers from the defense-including the unbelievable interception by Kiko Alonzo? How about the catches by Tunei, the grueling runs by LaMichael James, the touchdown catch by Barner, and on and on on. This was a team win and there are many heroes. Bravo to all the Ducks!!!

It's around this time of year that the familiar impulse takes hold. Hungry for the heady aroma of seldom-used seasonings like allspice and cloves, we find ourselves rooting around in the recesses of the spice cabinet.

For others, it's the only time to dust off tart pans and cookie cutters.

1. The Colts have a long, long way to go. They’ve gutted the entire organization, from the club president on down through the coaching staff and team leaders like Peyton Manning, Jeff Saturday and Dallas Clark.

Montrose's restlessness spilled over into his music. He dropped out of Van Morrison's band after helping record and tour "Tupelo Honey." He quit the Edgar Winter Group after the release of hits "Free Ride" and "Frankenstein."

In addition to preparing ourselves, we need to prepare our children. It's a difficult conversation to have, and it is one we must learn to undertake. One of the better suggestions I've heard in the wake of the Penn State scandal is that children shouldn't just have one or two parents they feel safe going to for help. They should have five "safe adults," and if one does not help, they can go to the next.

Districts also saw record levels of voter turnout last year, Belluscio said, with turnout doubling compared to the prior year. Many attributed this increase and the record budget defeats to Gov.

Shurmur: "I think that what you do is, you pick them, you bring them in, you work with them and then you confirm what you thought and then you move forward. I think there are always some surprises. Who would have predicted that Jason Pinkston would have played every snap, picked where he was a year ago? That is why you pick the guys you like, that you think can make your club at the positions you pick them at. Now that we have chosen these guys, and there is reasons why, once we get them here and work with them, that is probably a much better question now, after we go through some of the practice time here in the spring."
That hasn't been the only tinkering since the standards were last reviewed April 17. A rule requiring the city to get 24 hours notice of a spill has been pulled, saying instead the operator must give whatever notice is required by state and federal law.

Dear Margo: I've been close to "Maggie" for 30 years, from the time we were young mothers in our 20s. We've always had a joke pledge that we would never do anything to our faces. I don't know what your position is, but we both thought it was unnecessary and phony. Well, lo and behold, Maggie, after some weeks away ("visiting a cousin"), returns looking, uh, quite refreshed. I mean, the wrinkles are gone, and so are the jowls. What would you suggest I say to open this discussion? — Longtime Friend

Shyne thinks the contradiction is in people's minds. "I learn and study as an Israelite but live in a world where we have to use guns. It's a tough world out there," he said while premiering two videos in a Jerusalem club this year. "I see soldiers with guns at the kotel — the Western Wall — every day."

Keep the Hawks here and forget about an NHL franchise; whether we 'deserve' a NHL team or not is irrelevant, a true 'pro' game would ruin the atmosphere and the fun and frivolity. Support the Winterhawks and those long term fans AND the families that help the young men adjust to Portland and to being on their own. Many 'team' families have been doing this for over 20 years! THAT'S another story I want to hear about; those dedicated 'foster' Mom's and Dads.
Waelterman said he typically asks officials for $250,000 or about 5,000 tons of salt each July. Add that to what's left over from the prior year, and he has more than enough for a heavy year.

At the end of March, Obama's team reported contributions totaling nearly $197 million. The Romney campaign reported contributions of more than $87 million. Mr. Romney, of course, has been forced to spend heavily to fend off rival after rival, and President Obama currently has 10 times the amount of cash on hand. Still, according to Bloomberg News, that advantage slips to a less impressive two-to-one when money raised by the Romney super PAC and other independent Republican groups is taken into account. Ultimately, the total expenditures to elect Mr. Romney could match what is spent to keep Mr. Obama in the White House.

NBC EMPLOYEES have some mandatory summer reading ahead of them that won't be anywhere near as pulse-pounding as "Fifty Shades of Grey." A network insider tells us that in an eye-raising instance of life-imitating-"30 Rock," a low-level staffer at the Comcast-owned network went around handing out copies of "An Incredible Dream: Ralph Roberts and the Story of Comcast." The 424-page doorstop of a book was written by William Novak and reportedly commissioned by Comcast, which may have something to do with why the book is not available on Amazon.

He threw 216 innings last season. He only pitched 19 innings with three-run lead or bigger. In those games, he was 5-0. That many nights on the tightrope can cause some high anxiety. Surely, Masterson felt it. He just rarely if ever showed it.

A: Hey, Josh: I do believe they see Thompson as a starting power forward, but he has lots of work to do offensively. His offensive deficiencies are made more glaring by the lack of scoring around him. The Cavs are hoping a strong summer and a chance to work with Zydrunas Ilgauskas will help. Obviously, if the Cavs won the lottery, they should take Davis and proceed accordingly.

St. Louis political and business leaders seem convinced that they've found a real opportunity, and that Chinese airlines have genuine interest in flying here.

Designers Charlie Groppetti and Todd Smith grew up in the country and have happy memories of their childhood homes and a simpler life.

Not bad. But it's still less than a drop in the bucket. And in terms of a business, Foursquare is probably still light years behind Where, which has been around for five years and has become profitable by developing a service for sites such as Pandora that uses a person's location to offer ads for nearby businesses. It's less trendy than check-ins (which Where does have), but it's the more robust business for the moment. And it makes Where's future look more plausible.

Ordinary readers, however, may be more drawn to Kissinger's entertaining and sometimes gossipy accounts of his meetings with China's most august leaders. He describes, for example, Mao's "bantering and elliptical style of conversation … Mao advocated his ideas in a Socratic manner. He would begin with a question or an observation and invite comment. He would then follow with another observation. Out of this web of sarcastic remarks, observations and queries would emerge a direction, though rarely a binding commitment."

THE ISSUE: The Social Security system, which marked its 75th anniversary last year, was established as a pay-as-you-go social insurance program, whereby benefits to retirees are paid out of payroll tax contributions from current workers. Critics, most recently Texas Gov. Rick Perry, have called it a "Ponzi scheme." Supporters call it a vital "intergenerational compact."

Not every department would see cuts. The plan calls for a slight increase in the police department's current budget of $89.7 million. And the Health Department would see its budget increase by about $600,000 next year.
Haridopolos, the flip side. Here's the good news on our Brevard County legislator: He's one of the few leaders standing tall when it comes to pill mills. While Gov. Rick Scott wants to get rid of a database for heavy users of prescription drugs — something that has broad bipartisan support from politicians and law enforcement — Haridopolos is standing firm. "We have no interest whatsoever of scrapping that database," he said in a recent story by the News Service of Florida. "I strongly believe that we have to get a handle on this." Haridopolos is right. That doctors in Florida prescribe more oxycodone than doctors in the other 49 states combined is appalling. So, good for Haridopolos for having such backbone. Heck, more backbone and fewer book deals, Senator, and this may be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

At Kenyon, Storer belonged to the Delta Phi fraternity and the Middle Kenyon Association. In 1963, he told The Plain Dealer, "I never planned a radio career. I studied law at Harvard and discovered I would only be a mediocre lawyer.... My father put me into the music library in our Miami station."

The feeling of warmth, comfort and well-aged tradition come from the convergence of an 1894 building and the talents of an artistic and entrepreneurial French woman. Dorothy Mitrani-Bell received her degree in architecture from UC Berkeley in 1992, and a few years later took over an existing run-of-the-mill restaurant and transformed it into an outpost of Provence, complete with the most charming patio in the East Bay and a heavily French menu. Now she's started offering dinner.

Though there are many themes coursing through this movie, its primary concern is how anyone copes with a loss like this one.

In Hanks' hands, Thomas is kind, funny, clever and fascinated by his son. He also becomes the film's primary source of comfort.

Now, we could have replaced two people, but I just didn't feel it was right. Ian and Mike were so important in that band. I said to Robert (Fripp) at the time, "I'll form a new band if you like.

So sommeliers particularly have become champions of more - and more accurate - alcohol disclosure. Perhaps that's because diners have only their own assumptions to rely on when browsing a wine list. Perhaps it's because wine directors have to pair wines with food - there's a reason one Australian winemaker dubbed high-octane specimens "cocktail wines" - or because they want their customers to walk out the door, not stagger.

øDrawing from actual events in Van Gogh's life, Laurence Anholt's book weaves a story about how a little boy named Camille befriends the artist. Camille and his family appeared in paintings created by Van Gogh. This interactive story reveals how, although Van Gogh painted vibrant paintings of the village people and its surroundings, the townspeople of Camille's village thought the painter was odd and ostracized him. But Camille and his family accepted Van Gogh and saw the genius of his work. The book contains 19 puzzles which kids play to bring the characters within the book to life. By tapping illustrations of characters, kids can activate a mode that lets them see the gears and mechanisms that would make the character move. By tapping again on the character, the mechanisms spring apart so that kids can connect them once again. When they do, the character will now appear to animate in the story. Kids can also use simple art tools to repaint the characters so that they appear on the pages how they would like them to look. With soothing background music and the ability to be transported to a museum for closer inspection of Van Gogh's work, this is a great way for kids to learn about this artist and 10 of his famous paintings.

This led me to the decision to let them pick their own dresses. I gave them a color, and have sent emails with images of dresses that are in line with what I envision. We’ve all agreed (and so far have kept up our promise) to be honest with each other about what each bridesmaid decides. When I get out of hand —I spent a week telling my Maid of Honor sister to find something white, which would clash horribly with my ivory dress — they gently tell me to consult a color wheel. When one bridesmaid sent a link to a short, pink, bandage dress, I kindly reminded her that this is a wedding, not a girls weekend in South Beach.

"In a perfect world, a year seems like a reasonable time for a young, well-educated person to get back on their financial feet, but it depends on their personal financial situation. If (they) have to go and pay off a bank or lost a home and lost a job, things can get pretty severe," said Hilary Martin, a certified financial planner at the San Jose-based Family Wealth Consulting Group. "Just having them move in with no (exit) agreement and kind of a hush-hush idea about money because you don't want to pressure them is not really a good idea. Be supportive but also have expectations."

Brandon Rice remembers well the way he fell in love with numbers.
Darvish only walked two batters after walking at least four in each of his previous three starts. He enjoyed plenty of success with his cut fastball, throwing 20 of 27 for strikes while recording five swings and misses. It was a particularly effective weapon against left-handed hitters.

The building's many challenges will make it one of a kind and pioneering, but it's fundamentally an urban office building, Bowers said.

Revelations of neglect, theft and other misconduct by guardians and conservators prompted Minnesota lawmakers to strengthen oversight of the unlicensed profession in 2009, but advocates say the system still falls short. While guardians and conservators must register with the courts by 2013, they are not required to pass any tests or possess any specialized skills. Applicants are required to submit to a criminal background check, but court officials don't have to determine whether applicants have been disciplined for misconduct by a state licensing board.

Even worse, it could put about 156,000 lives at risk should the unthinkable happen and a major Mississippi River flood occur. That's the number of people who live in areas "protected" by those inadequate levees. Many of them live in poverty.

Instead, an English-only bill is touted as the quickest way to help immigrants succeed. If that is the case why aren't the same good intentions a ringing endorsement of the Maryland Dream Act? Why wait and hope to see if any of these shiftless immigrants will wise up and learn English in Anne Arundel County out of brute necessity when the students who could benefit from the Dream Act have already demonstrated enough English proficiency and good conduct (i.e. paying taxes and applying for citizenship) in order to justify receiving a modest college tuition break?
I just stopped by a store in rural central Oregon and the storeowner had to get off the phone to run my credit card. This is substantial in a few ways: 1) broadband would allow simultaneous use of voice and data, 2) credit cards authorized over dial-up are prone to additional fees (on low-margin and small-ticket items, such as my snack, this could mean a loss) and 3) cellular service is inadequate to augment landline voice or provide "pseudo-broadband" through 3G services.

In some cases, the directors gave their stars confidence.

What Gould is saying is that in a world this over-saturated, where we are overwhelmed by either obligation or distraction, the most essential act is the emptiest, the one that forces us to face that there is nothing behind humanity's facade. "Not one of the works of art in the gallery," he says of an attack on the Tate Modern, "remotely matched the limitless potency of a terrorist bomb." And later: "To keep the world sane we depend on motive, we rely on cause and effect. Kick those props away and we see that the meaningless act is the only one that has any meaning."

It is clearly not acceptable in a free and secular society for Ms. Campbell and her supporters to use the power of the state to impose their religious beliefs upon those of us who believe differently - unless, of course, Ms. Campbell can prove scientifically exactly when a fertilized egg becomes "human."

First, the 2 percent increase in undergraduate tuition and room and board is lower than in years past, and should allow us to meet anticipated mandated cost increases - such as Jesuit affirmative action hires and student disability services - as well as increases in the cost of other services and products we purchase. Consequently, there is a very limited amount of money for new spending. This budget sends a message to our students and their families that we are aware of the financial realities they are facing.

In class, she studied the issue of rape in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Then she worked on the Institute's exhibit, "Congo/Women: Portraits of War," which examined the scourge of sexual violence against women and toured 20 U.S. cities.

Q: If prices do fall further, does it follow that many homeowners will feel less wealthy, and they'll reduce spending and that will slow the economy?
The best parts of the film, for me, came toward the end, when the lives of the four lovers become bittersweet and melancholy. They were so happy for a time. They were inseparable. Now it is all over. There's a flashback where they walk together down to the farm pond to wash off the flour. As they dry contentedly in the sun, Teri still has a little flour behind her ear. You can't do better than that.
Companies that can't recruit American-trained foreigners to work in the United States may opt to hire them at offshore locations.

The constants in Niles' peripatetic childhood in Dayton, Tenn., and Los Angeles — after 15 residential moves, she stopped counting — were ballet, jazz, tap dance and competition baton twirling. ("Very Southern of me, right?!") She didn't want a career behind a desk, like her mother, who worked as a claims adjuster, paralegal and office manager while also playing piano in church. While Niles was studying at USC, she was given an increasing number of administrative duties by Erwin Washington, executive director of Lula Washington Dance Theatre, the 32-year-old repertory ensemble devoted to dance that tackles social issues and African American culture. It became clear that her star as an executive was rising faster than it would as a dancer. She became company manager when she graduated college.

Donna A. Gilroy - Patrick Gilroy
This is something that should have been seized upon by the Republican presidential candidates. It had all the elements found in the common GOP narrative about President Barack Obama.

What we also know is this was John Elway's draft. Even though the organization is administered by the equally empowered triumvirate of EFX — Elway, John Fox and Brian Xanders — the executive vice president and Face of the Broncos didn't just hold the tiebreaking vote this year; he made the ultimate critical decisions.
Despite a growing embrace of environmentalism among many designers, so-called sustainable fashion continues to conjure notions of burlap. Awards show commentators rarely use the term — elegance just isn't synonymous with eco-friendly living.

She pointed to some of the novel's flaws, noting, "The evident and unfortunate influence of Thomas Pynchon's recent fiction can be hard to ignore.

Context: The sweet fruit and soft tannins of the cabernet franc make it one of those rare red wines that can be sipped just on its own, though it also has the spine to stand up to barbecued tri-tip, grilled chicken with a berry sauce, or braised pork with a salsa built on pineapple and orange.
But one can only live on a diet of ramen and unrealized potential for so long. Lucas Neff, the actor and Chicago native who wrote "The Last Duck," knows this intimately (the play continues through Sunday at the Viaduct Theatre).

"When they asked me if I would mind working with a student therapist, I said no, that would be fine," Van Almsick said.

Jill is going to be one of the truly great therapists."

Union Rags, the Michael Matz-trained colt, was named the second choice by Churchill Downs handicapper Mike Battaglia, at 9-2. He’ll start from the fourth position.

"I'm not usually the person to open up, and be crying or whatever," she says. Toward the end of filming, trainers Bob Harper and Jillian Michaels were pushing her to get in touch with her feelings. "And there was something deeper there," she says. "I found out that I wasn't really emotionally connecting. That was one of the core issues, and I didn't even realize it.

Detroit's public-sector unions have already made concessions over the last year, supposedly to avoid a financial manager. The so-called "consent" agreement thus throws city workers and the residents who depend on them under the bus -- provided there are any working city buses left to throw us under by the time these cuts are finished.
No one is trying to get out of paying a bill, here. It's just that you want to make sure you're paying your bill, not someone else's. I asked National about your case, and a representative contacted you, and said proper procedures hadn't been followed in your case. They dropped their claim against you.
At summer barbecues, the most fail-safe way to perk up grilled meat, fish or vegetables is with a fun condiment. And in today's cover story on Page K1, we provide several options for making your own. They can all be held in the fridge for at least a week or two to complete a last-minute meal.

Filling out this volume, and taking up more space than the verse, is extended commentary on the poems by Burnett, a professor of English at Boston University and editor of the Oxford editions of A.E. Housman's poems and letters. Burnett's tireless tracking down of bits and pieces of Larkin's work and his erudite annotations are an impressive act of scholarship. But while this volume certainly belongs in university libraries -- providing an amazingly detailed map of Larkin's development as an artist -- it will strike nonacademic readers as a form of overkill. Most readers will be far happier with "Collected Poems," edited by Anthony Thwaite, or a collection selected by Martin Amis.
CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Chrysler's sales fell 9 percent, despite big gains in its more fuel-efficient cars thanks to the "cash for clunkers" government rebate program.

“It’s going to be a real tough game, a ground-it out game,” Rozier said. “It’s going to be a battle inside.”
But mostly, the proponents don't talk about problems, and they certainly don't talk about the lack of standards for labeling or quality control. They talk about how great dispensaries will be. They talk about the jobs that will be created. They talk about the millions that will be generated by program taxes and fees. And they talk about the sick and suffering people who would benefit from medical marijuana but don't know where to get it, how to grow it or where to turn.
"I think if you listen to the people that are getting services or providing them, I think you can do some good things," he said. "If people believe that they are met halfway by their leaders, I think the odds are in our favor."

Jordan Cargile and Breanna Casper were the one-two combination for top-ranked Eastern Tech softball Wednesday. Cargile threw a no-hitter and Casper led the bats as the host Mavericks defeated Western Tech, 11-0.
Let's see. The Bruins got here by virtue of a tiebreaker, a USC bowl ban, and the fact that they didn't have to play Oregon in the regular season. Which is only to say they are going to be ushered into Autzen Stadium next Friday, and they'll look around, see the shiny championship trophy, and all the fans screaming, and smile, just before they realize that this whole thing is a set-up and they're the meal.

The picture grows even murkier for the Yankees a year from now. By then Pettitte, Garcia and veteran right-hander Hiroki Kuroda will be at the end of their contracts. None of them are safe bets to keep pitching in 2013.

Some grains take special treatment. Quinoa is the trickiest. Cooked the wrong way, it can taste soapy and bitter. But blame the cook, not the grain. Quinoa grains come covered in a natural, plant-generated pesticide called saponin; they must be thoroughly rinsed before cooking.

"We're not trying to hide anything. We are out in the open," said Abdul A. Muhammad, the imam of the Masjid Ali Muslim mosque in Newark. "You want to come in? We have an open door policy."
But I realized with astonishment that it had been 40 years since I had expressed a feeling so spontaneously to a black person -- so pervasive and encompassing and overwhelming is the race-consciousness our society. Los Angeles and Simi Valley demonstrated how adept we have become, we whites, in shutting out our recognition of the essential humanity of all peoples, in consigning those of other races to their own worlds and living within our own.
Trenton used four pitchers who combined to allow nine hits and 10 walks. The Thunder had scored two runs in the eighth inning on an RBI single by Cody Johnson and a fielder’s choice grounder hit by Melky Mesa.

Tourists and passers-by flocked to the scene at the Hyatt, as did many of San Diego County's tiny Tibetan community. The latter had been alerted in advance by Lama Tensing, the Dalai Lama's special emissary and an occasional county resident.

Kesselring was equal to the task. She fought her way out of the back by coming wide on the bell lap to bring the Ducks home in 11 minutes 5.85 seconds. It wasn’t enough to catch Washington, which won the race in 11:05.20, But it was good enough to leave Lananna where he wanted to be heading into the final day of the meet.

This was the final lighting ceremony Rogge will attend as IOC president. He will step down in 2013, at the end of his third four-year term.
At the center, and leading off the menu, is a bulging plate of house-produced charcuterie, featuring on one recent visit a thick pile of aggressive chorizo; pungent salami; pork rillettes resembling an emulsified pork roast; a thick slab of chunky pate studded with pistachios and a cloud of pork-liver mousse -- all set off by dazzlingly crunchy Lovejoy Bakers bread. Nothing that you'd want to confess to your cardiologist, but with a glass of wine -- a dozen are available by the glass, along with some unusual beers -- it could carry you through a serene, porcine evening.

The no-frills airline advertises base fares as low as $9 but then charges passengers for everything from placing a carry-on bag in the overhead bin to having a glass of water onboard. In January it plans to start charging $5 for each boarding pass a ticket agent prints.
Gerry Gillen, executive director of the levee district, said it was no cause for alarm. The water was clear, giving no sign of erosion or damage. It might even have been residual water from a recent rain.
The fried-green tomatoes are back, too. If you've grown indifferent to menu information about sourcing, these might win you back. The firm tomatoes are from George's, just up the road; the mellow goat cheese is from Cherry Glen Farm in Montgomery County, and the smoked bacon and basil are from nearby Truck Patch Farms. None of this dedication would matter if the breading wasn't so tasty and the tomatoes weren't fried so nicely.
Sarkozy also pushed for a new era of industrial relations when he came to power in 2007. But unions still hold enormous sway in France. When he faced down transit unions just months after his election over the scrapping of an early retirement age, it seemed a seminal moment for a country long hemmed in by organized labor. However, by 2010, strikes again paralyzed France as he fought to raise the retirement age to 62.
The Lynx went 27-7 during the regular season in 2011, and 7-1 in the playoffs.
It took courage for Major Gen. Mark Graham, former commander at Fort Carson, to speak openly about the violence there and champion improvements in mental health care. Graham's son, Kevin, an ROTC cadet, committed suicide in 2003. His other son, Jeff, was killed by a roadside bomb in Iraq the following year.
This is the first time in the history of our city that the mayor has been left with no staff to conduct the taxpayers’ business. This “do-nothing” action by the four council members is both draconian and egregious in nature.
Jamming a government health care takeover through the House of Representatives using stealth, deception, trickery and just plain bald-faced lies woke up the saner elements of the nation to the fact that -- wow, they really won't stop at anything.

The new teacher evaluation system required by the state will tie student achievement to teacher pay. But Vogel said the board is unlikely to have the money in coming years to give the district's many top teachers promised raises unless the Legislature comes up with a lot of cash.
The Post-Dispatch previously reported that 41 of 45 deaths in child care in the prior four years occurred in unlicensed home day cares.

Ron Wooten said the blast was reported around 3 p.m. at Massey Energy's Upper Big Branch mine in Raleigh County, about 30 miles south of Charleston. The company did not provide details on the extent of the damage. A Boone County ambulance dispatcher also said he has the same number of fatalities and missing miners.
There are plenty of explosions, sure, and fight scenes, and gadgetry. There’s Leonardo DiCaprio as the hero, Marion Cotillard as the femme fatale and enough globe-trotting locations to fuel two 007 films.

Take the Great Ocean Road about 70 miles west out of Melbourne and you'll hit Torquay. A road to the south eventually cuts across what used to be Mrs. Bell's farm. From parking spots above a bluff, a staircase leads down to a cove-shaped stretch of sand that is Bells Beach, the most legendary surf spot on the continent. It's celebrated as the birthplace of professional surfing, at least in Australia. Bells claims to have the world's oldest continuous pro surfing contest, going back to 1961. Part of the appeal, and the challenge, of Bells is that it's the flip side of the Gold Coast. Getting there and staying there is a chore. But it's one that feels more special than the Gold Coast (for Southern Californians, it's like the difference between Huntington Beach and Trestles). The down side is that you can make the trip all the way out to Bells and hit a day when the surf isn't up to par and the contest is off. It's a long way back to the city. I checked it out on a drive along the Great Ocean Road, one of the world's best scenic drives – Australia's version of Highway 1, except with kangaroos.

There has been widespread criticism of how the school's administration has handled hazing within the band.
Since then, however, the issue has largely been dropped because, after the last amnesty on Jan. 13., "the Home Ministry stated clearly that they freed all of them," Win Mra said.
Curtis Granderson put the Yankees ahead in the first with his ninth homer, a drive off the ribbon board in front of the upper deck in right. Davis, who had three hits, tied it in the second with his fifth homer, and Hardy's two-run drive gave Baltimore a 3-1 lead in the third.
Bowman, who plans to keep teaching at the Erikson Institute, encouraged new district administrators to continue investing in early childhood. And she said her eight years at the district taught her "there is no quick fix."

Timberland's Josh McDonald had arguably the best individual performance on the boys side at the GAC South meet.
A: Well, he is still dead. But no, what happened was I was sitting at a restaurant and looked across and saw a tabloid newspaper with the headline "James Brown is dead," so I took that, the same font and everything, and just cut it out of these billboard papers. But my thought was, which James Brown? There was the Little Richard James Brown, the I'm-Black-and-I'm Proud James Brown, there was the crackhead James Brown. There've been so many James Browns, I thought, "Which one?"
Kulesh was crossing Grove Street in Elizabeth on Feb. 1, 2006, when she was hit and killed by a driver talking on her cell phone, Vence and her husband, John Guslavage, said. Phone records the couple provided show the woman’s cell was in use for 21 seconds at 10:45 a.m., the time of death listed by the medical examiner.
DETROIT - This time last year, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra was about a month removed from a contentious musicians' strike that worsened its already strained finances. Now, the rebounding organization aims to raise the roof — and hopefully $1 million — with help from a hometown musician known more for rock, rap and country than classical.

Lyons received the NATO Medal, three Army Achievement Medals, the National Defense Service Medal and the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with campaign star.
The DNA hit - matching a convicted drug offender to a cup found in the car where the two men were killed - is contentious for another reason. A St. Louis police detective didn't disclose the DNA result for four months after he was notified of it, leaving the defense to hear of the evidence just four days before the retrial. As a result, that trial has been pushed back. Love-El remains in jail, waiting to see how the DNA test will affect his case.
But she didn't return, and the girl's mother said she got several cryptic calls from one of the young suspects, first telling her that Monae was on her way home, and then inquiring if she had made it. Moran said Tuesday that on some of the calls, the boy simply said he was calling to say "Hi."
“It’s helped me a lot, I’m way more dialed in,’’ Smith said.

Slow-cooked poulard came next, a perfect snowy white medallion that sat in the round indention of an oversize square plate, with a meat sauce on one side, a puree of cardoons on the other, and an olive with a leafy sprig of lamb's quarter. It was nicely paired with a 2007 Robert Groffier Bourgogne Rouge.

Though last year's numbers appear small compared with the vastness of the Gulf, they represent a fraction of the actual number of tiger shrimp believed to be in the Gulf and along the Eastern Seaboard, Fuller says. Most of the tiger shrimp counted last year came from Louisiana and the Carolinas' coasts, she says.
Better still, don't make principals responsible for reporting incidents. Some try to improve their schools' or their own images by underreporting violent incidents. Vallas should explore giving school police officers or another third party the authority to report incidents to the district.
Pedigree: Wheat fans rejoice, this is a good one. Very wheaty, with a hint of spice (orange? cinnamon?) and low in alcohol (4.8 percent). Its old-style brewing technique does not involve the usual, giant vertical cylinders you see in brewpubs, but rather a more open process. And don't worry about that sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Even those who don't like wheat should give this a try. It's not overpowering and, like some hoppy ales that can turn off non-ale drinkers, this may pique the interest of wheat novices (like myself). I first tasted wheat beer in the early '90s, and it's still not my cup of tea, er, brew. But this cloudy beer beckoned me to try another. (By the way, in German "keller" means "cellar" and "hefe" means "yeast.")
The small dining room is clean and tidy with a mix of comfortable tables. Grab a menu, place your order at the counter and take a seat. Dishes are prepared fresh, so the "express" part of the restaurant's name may not live up to its billing for some diners. Our meals took about 10 minutes to arrive at the table but the wait wasn't a problem for us.
Dear Dr. Donohue - I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia. The problem is that people look at me and think I don't look sick, so how could I feel so bad. My muscles hurt.

Stanton has delivered monster RBI totals at every level, starting in high school. As a senior at O'Fallon in 2009, he was second in the Southwestern Conference with 63 RBI, one behind teammate Nick Tindall (64), who established the league record that spring. Stanton's 119 RBI during his career at O'Fallon are the fifth most in the Southwestern Conference since it took on its current eight-school lineup starting with the 2000-01 school year. Stanton is one of 13 players in the same period to compile a .400-plus career batting average.
This is the same argument Mal Nesheim and I used in our book, "Feed Your Pet Right." If American pets were not fed byproducts of human food production, they would need the equivalent of food for 42 million people.
In Argentina, the Roadblock required one team member to jump out of an airplane and the other team member to drive to a marked location to meet up. The non-jumping sister turned her car off the road at the wrong spot and got stuck in some deep sand. She had to wait for friendly locals to drive past and tow her car out. If not for the friendly locals, they would have lost the race right there.
That will require seismic shifts and a lot more money. Currently, more than 25 percent drop out of high school and only about 40 percent get an associate's degree or higher.
Karol Ruiz, 32, who previously worked in the social work field, said she never thought she’d be unemployed for a year — especially with a college degree. But Ruiz, a single mother of an 11-year-old, said if she can’t land an ideal job before her benefits expire, she’ll bartend or clean houses.

The team that won each event was presented a ribbon and the grand prize winner received “bragging rights,” Vazquez said.
The unit has since been totally remodeled, and my family has received a bill for $23,000 in damages. It sounds to me as if the landlord is trying to have my family pay for the remodeling, which is in addition to the $1,000 damage deposit that was kept. One of the repairs my mom and brother are being charged for is new kitchen flooring, which was old and cracked when they moved in.
To say that "The Giant Mechanical Man" is a small independent film is to ignore its great ambition. It dares to go where no big-screen superhero or mega-spy will tread -- into the bittersweet land of life's little disappointments.
If you know a freeze is coming, you can protect peonies by tossing a sheet over them, or, if they're not very tall, by putting a cardboard box over them, with a weight on top, he said.
The music and media conference and festival takes place March 12-16 and is headquartered at the Austin Convention Center downtown. Most industry officials purchase badges months in advance, but walk-ups are welcome. The walk-up rate for the music portion of the convention (badges are also available for the film and interactive conferences) is $650 and theoretically gets you in to all SXSW music and media-related events. However, past experience has shown that even if you have a badge, you're not necessarily guaranteed admission to especially popular events. Capacity means capacity—and even the biggest of venues here reach it—so if there's an act you're dying to see, plan ahead and show up early.
The company and its unions say they are in good-faith negotiations about pension changes, but clearly some reductions are coming and some jobs will be lost. But the unions want investors, creditors and other stakeholders to share the burden. If the bankruptcy court allows the company to dump its pension obligations, the government's Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. would be on the hook (hello, deficits).
Maybe this is a Yormark family deal. It was Brett Yormark, Michael’s twin brother, who barked at a Nets fan two years ago for wearing a paper bag -- the oldest fan protest in the book -- during the team’s 14th straight home loss.

That was the Cadets' ninth consecutive victory to end the season, a run that included strong starting pitching from three Division I hurlers -- seniors G.J. Strauss (Western Kentucky), Derek Mazzio (St. Louis University) and junior David Schmidt (Stanford) -- and an offense that averaged 8.8 runs per game during that stretch.
Syria claimed that Palestine had always been part of its territory. Iraq sought Palestine for access to the Mediterranean. Egypt believed that, as the most populous Arab state, it should annex Palestine. And Trans-Jordan (later Jordan), a state carved out of the largest chunk of Palestine by Britain for its Arab clients from neighboring Hejaz, hoped to absorb the remainder.
The Taco Truck opened for business in Jersey City in late September, but recently it and other trucks at Exchange Place were told by policemen to move after complaints from nearby storefront restaurants. So for the time being, the truck is more or less stationed in Hoboken. But those who follow the taco-mobile on Twitter and Facebook — where else? — can find out where it will be parked from day to day.
Senser, 45, who's married to former Minnesota Vikings star Joe Senser, faces three counts of criminal vehicular homicide for hitting Phanthavong, 38, as he put gas in his stalled vehicle on the Riverside Avenue exit ramp for Interstate 94.

"I don't think that's going to be in one fell swoop," he said. "So we have to post those numbers and provide some consistent results. Over the next couple of years that will happen," he said.
“I felt like the win and loss was on me,” he said. “I felt like I should have put us up by three and we shouldn't have been in that situation. So that was important for me.”
Obama was introduced by Jeff Klayo, a worker from Chrysler's Sterling Stamping Plant who was laid off for six months before the rescue, but got his job back after government money kept the company alive.
"That is the neat part of here, and maybe what we've built," Izzo said. "It's not me, and I'm not being that modest. It's the system, it's the guys, it's the assistant coaches -- they've got everything down. They're working on three different games right now and, hopefully, we can use it."

I had another embarrassing experience when I was a freshman at Yale. I took a psychology class and remember almost nothing about the class. One morning, the professor started talking about sex.

I remember very little about the fainting experience. Again this experience might teach one to expect the unexpected.

In his speech, Cameron decried multiculturalism's "hands-off tolerance" of some cultural behaviors -- he used the example of forced marriages -- that are antithetical to Western values.

Arda: I think because The Rock is returning for WrestleMania 28, on top of the fact that he is in great shape and certainly has more than a handful of top-level matches left in him, it seems likely more than ever that the "passing of the torch" that many are predicting won't actually happen. For the first time in a larger-than-life WrestleMania main event, we may see interference. Say someone like The Miz costs Cena the match. The Rock wins and is strong going into his next match in WWE when he returns, Cena has a new rivalry to occupy him post WrestleMania, and someone (like Miz) is elevated to main-event level once again. It feels right for something like that to happen. Give me The Rock with a Rock Bottom and the 1-2-3 after some interference by The Miz.

But a plan won't prevent another major flood from occurring or protect people whose lives would be at risk if it did. Only repairs to the levees can do that. Parts of the Metro East flood-control system date back to the 1930s. River water is seeping underneath the levees. Old pumps and drainage tiles must be replaced. Making those repairs could cost as much as $180 million. But 65 percent of the cost eventually could be recovered if Congress appropriates funds to pay for the work - as it should.

The Harp Tree apparently was already old when Terry's great-grandpa arrived in the late 19th century. Born in Switzerland, well educated, a trained musician who delighted in playing his Stradivarius, Henry Scharrer chose to be a farmer and a fisherman. His visitors over decades included Cuban netters, shipwrecked sailors and tourists from the coast, the poet Carl Sandburg among them.

WASHINGTON -- Ohio's governor, attorney general and most state Republican elected officials have deep problems with the Affordable Care Act, especially its mandate that nearly all Americans must get health insurance by 2014.

First, and perhaps foremost, is the timing of the hospital's accusations that I implanted stents in patients who did not need them. These charges, which originated from someone within the hospital community, conveniently surfaced as St. Joseph Medical Center and its Denver-based owner Catholic Health Initiatives (CHI) was entangled in a federal investigation of misconduct between them and MidAtlantic Cardiovascular Associates. As my troubles became front-page news, St. Joseph Medical Center moved to the back page.

Instead, pastry chef Renee Cade puts real thought into her creations. I especially enjoyed the savory "Bleu," served on a wooden block artistically arranged with blue-cheese sponge cake, hazelnut biscotti, port-soaked grapes and a few shards of blue cheese.

French onion soup is hard for me to pass up when it's on a menu.

The kitchen thoroughly respects its ingredients, and the unaffected preparations are a welcome change from the cooking of star-power chefs who substitute exuberant pileups on the plate for the simple integrity of those ingredients.

"When I say it's not even in the same universe," McCarthy said, "it really isn't. Last year was a mandatory shutdown; I could barely breathe without wincing. This is nothing. It's a step above just kind of a premonition that something doesn't feel quite right."
The measure is modeled on Cooley's attempt in 2006 to modify the law and his long-standing policy to rarely seek a third strike unless the offense is a violent or serious crime.
Some commentators have compared the pepper-spraying to police actions at Kent State, which is absurd. Four students died at Kent State. But it's also absurd to reflexively support what the police did, and not inquire how it happened.
"The victims would be the prison guards who have worked for the state for ten years and still make no more than the guards hired last year. The victims would be the community health nurses whose salaries now give them $1,500 less buying power than they had three years ago.
Dear Margo: I am a couponer who has been lucky to stockpile expensive products. My question concerns my coupons and etiquette. Is it acceptable to use items from my stockpile as gifts? For example, a friend of the family is having a baby. They are struggling financially, and the husband was laid off soon after the wife found out she was pregnant. In lieu of a gift I asked the woman to come over and "shop" at my house. I wanted to help cut their expenses so the money they do have can be used for other things. Since I have every thing from cleaning supplies to personal hygiene items to baby wipes, I thought it more prudent to help with everyday items, rather than buy, say, baby clothes. Do you think this is appropriate? I do not want to come off as cheap. The woman will be taking home more than $250 in products that are the best name-brand items. Because of the coupons, though, I only paid about $20 for it all. I also make gift baskets of full size and sample-sized matching items from the stockpile. What do you think of this? — Coupon Crazy in Kansas City

The chicken salad sub ($7.75) features smooth, creamy chicken salad made from all-white meat. The hot sausage sub ($6.70), while tasty enough, is nowhere near hot. The meatball sub ($6.70) is Italian grandma-worthy, although you may wish for more sauce (which I promptly added at home).

“Got a couple key outs, that was basically it,” Hunter said. “I still got myself into a few more jams than I would have, letting guys get on base for free. That’s not good; it’s not fun. It’s not me, but we’re going to move on. We got a win. I’m happy about that, don’t get me wrong, but I’ve got some things to do. I’ll get better. “
Coming in with the bases loaded and no outs, Weaver induced a sacrifice fly, struck out Miami's cleanup hitter and forced a pop up to avoid a potentially dangerous situation. Lasting two more innings, it was the only run he would allow. In similar previous outings, he had allowed multiple runs and walks.
Tancredo said the state should roll back Medicaid eligibility to 2007 levels, something that would be prohibited by the new federal health care law. Even rolling eligibility back to levels permitted under the law might not save the state any money, because the most recent expansion in eligibility was funded by a fee paid by hospitals and then matched by federal dollars.

Nationally, home prices in the second quarter posted their first quarterly increase in three years, according to the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller national index released last week.
I'm sympathetic to the competitive strain the trucks can put on restaurants paying rent and facing strict regulations of their own. But the fact is that people like the trucks and want the variety they offer. Eventually the city must recognize the demand.

After an apprenticeship at La Casita Mexicana in Bell, she brought her moles to Moles La Tia, in the Maravilla neighborhood of East Los Angeles, and then to La Huasteca, the swank Mexican restaurant in the Plaza Mexico in Lynwood, where she introduced the concept of rotating menus devoted to a single Mexican region before going solo with Rocio's Mole de los Dioses in Bell and, since January, in Sun Valley. Her ink-black Oaxacan mole even won a citywide mole contest a couple of years ago, its rough, sunny complexity edging out Guelaguetza and Tlapazola Grill.
You’ll never guess which city was just ranked as the most fashionable in the country. Not Los Angeles, home to Hollywood fashionistas. Not New York, with its famous Fashion Week and legions of pouty, leggy models. No, the title goes to Orange County’s Irvine.
"It was a pretty average-looking house from the outside," said architect Bob Ganser of CityDeskStudio in Minneapolis. "But when I saw their eclectic mix of modern and folk art, it set the tone for the renovation."
The world's second-most-populous Muslim country is caught in a brutal internal struggle between extremism and moderation. Most of its people tell pollsters they don't like the United States and wish we'd go away. The tribesmen of its western frontier shelter Osama bin Laden and the leaders of Afghanistan's Taliban. And the United States can't forget how, in the 1980s, Pakistan built nuclear weapons -- and then later exported nuclear technology to North Korea and Iran.

"Last year was kind of difficult because you're going out there, you're running with the ones and twos, but you're not getting into the game," Daniels said. "So it's almost, ‘What am I practicing all this hard for?' But in the end, like I said, it came out to help. This year, I see the big picture."

There are about 1.6 million nonpostal federal workers. Of those, about 1.1 million are represented by more than 90 labor organizations. Some workers in agencies such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission can negotiate wages. Others in the FBI, the Government Accountability Office and other departments do not engage in collective bargaining.

In the parliamentary elections, surveys put the Progressives, who are pledging to end corruption and get the economy moving again, ahead of the Democrats. But analysts say that even if the Democrats win fewer seats, they are more likely to be able to find like-minded allies to form a coalition government.

"Bridesmaids" (Universal Studios Home Video, not rated/R, DVD $29.98; Blu-ray Disc $34.98). Raunchy and embarrassing (especially in mixed company), this gutter-mouthed comedy is also funny at times. Kristen Wiig of "Saturday Night Live" stars and co-wrote the script, which is why it has a late-night comic's dysfunctional view of relationships. The good themes about friendship and loyalty are undercut by Wiig's toxic take on female rivalry. Her character comes unhinged when her lifelong friend (Maya Rudolph) announces her engagement and brings a too-perfect new female acquaintance into the inner circle. If you like graphic depictions of what used to be called human intimacy and think nothing is funnier than explosive diarrhea, this one's for you. The new DVD includes both the theatrical cut and an unrated version with deleted footage. The cast joins director Paul Feig on a commentary track that pretty much excludes us from the fun, but it does explain why the film's setting is so jarring: Some of the exteriors were shot in Milwaukee and others in Chicago. Chi-waukee, anyone?
The Howell Central junior guard scored 13 points to pace the Spartans to a 37-25 victory in the district title game.
Lamb, 52, was a freelance photographer who now receives disability payments.

The screenwriters, who control everything (Mr. Goddard got his start on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," the TV series created by Mr. Whedon), have filled their film with big ideas. "The Cabin in the Woods" simultaneously celebrates and deconstructs the genre's conventions, while touching on questions of ethics as they apply to reality shows, and free will as it applies to all of us contestants in the game of real life, clinging as we do to the belief that we run our own shows. Yet the initial brilliance of the premise is eventually dulled by illogic, the whole thing proves unmanageable and the filmmakers unmanage their climactic revelation with far more zest than finesse.
But you and I know this is a reality show first and foremost and the only thing that keeps "The Voice" from joining the ranks of such long running reality shows like "Survivor," "The Apprentice" or "The Bachelor" is the absence of a Nasty Elimination Round Catch Phrase like "You're fired!" "Please pack your knives and go," "Your tour ends here," "The tribe has spoken," "Ding Dong, the door's for you." "Give me your jacket and leave" or "Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. You're dead to us." All right, I don't even know where that last one came from, but the fact that there's a directory of these phrases tells me that "The Voice" should have one too.
AThat's probably a better question to ask the gurus at our home office in Milwaukee. I'll say this: Our customers tell us they like the stability and consistency they see in Northwestern Mutual. Some insurers in the past have demutualized; we have not. Many others were merged and submerged. ... When clients walk in my office, the name on the door has existed for 155 years. They know we'll be there 50 or 60 years from now.
The Wolves posted a team GPA of 3.60, and were one of just 13 teams in the country to post a GPA of 3.6 or better. In the group of 13, fellow Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference member Minnesota State-Mankato also posted a 3.60 GPA for tops in the conference.

Now, we have made great strides over the last two years in using technology and getting rid of waste. Veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse. We’re selling acres of federal office space that hasn’t been used in years, and we will cut through red tape to get rid of more. But we need to think bigger. In the coming months, my administration will develop a proposal to merge, consolidate, and reorganize the federal government in a way that best serves the goal of a more competitive America. I will submit that proposal to Congress for a vote – and we will push to get it passed.

BringPetsHome.com is offering many discounts and waiving shipping fees during the holidays. A vast selection of gifts from stores like Walmart and Macy’s can be found online, with so many pet products available, it’s hard to pick one to feature.

The earlier letter authored by Rep. Tim Ryan of Niles and signed by the rest of Ohio's House of Representatives Democrats contended that the state was using tax dollars to "advance a privatization plan that could potentially severely cost drivers via increased tolls, threaten the job security of over 1,000 Ohioans, and drive up the costs for local governments through increased maintenance costs of local roads."

Prices also vary on how many days you want to travel or how many countries you want to visit. Do your research, plan your trip carefully and you can save money.

The ruling comes just two months after a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision held that religious employees of a church cannot sue for employment discrimination.

If signed, the California measure would mark the biggest victory yet for those who have long been pushing Amazon and others to pay their fair share of taxes. Currently, there is similar legislation on the books, or in process, in at least 14 other states.
Perhaps nothing more accurately summed up the night than a Lakers highlight-reel play late in the third quarter. Matthews was dribbling the ball on the perimeter when he inexplicably slipped and fumbled the ball away. Former Blazers point guard Steve Blake scooped the ball up for the Lakers and streaked to the other end of the court for a two-on-none fast break.

You could visit every year for the rest of your life and never run out of things to do and see. If you're still wary of going to Mexico, think of Yucatán as a country apart — many of its residents do.

If researchers could return to the young women they already had enrolled, and gauge their stress reactions to the Feb. 14 shootings, they could address three problems of past post-traumatic stress disorder research: they could capture all subjects' responses to the same trauma; they could assess participants' stress reactions in the context of personal histories that each reported before the shared trauma took place--information that could not have been colored by the shootings; and finally, they could distinguish those who already suffered significant post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms before the shared trauma event from those who developed the disorder specifically in response to the shootings. In addition, the researchers could test subjects for three different genetic variations linked to the disorder and see just how powerful an influence they were when other factors were held constant.

9:08 p.m.: After a brief solo acoustic intro, Justin Bieber lip syncs his way through "Never Say Never." A cameo by Jaden Smith doesn't help. Usher takes over for "Oh My Gosh" with a troupe of Usher lookalikes but any way you cut it, this is one of those silly production numbers that epitomizes everything bad about the Grammys.
As far as the concertos go, "Rachmaninoff was one of the greatest pianists of all time," Hough says. "He writes for the keyboard and the piano in the most astonishing ways.

But making music with the Impressions wasn't enough for Mayfield, who left the group in 1970. Out on his own, Mayfield addressed urban realities even more openly. Songs such as "(Don't Worry) If There's a Hell Below, We're All Gonna Go" were gritty, hard-hitting portrayals of inner-city life, the kind that had rarely been heard before in popular music. Mayfield's music also took on a harder, funkier edge at this time.

With U.S. farmers planting the largest crop of corn in 75 years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture expects the resulting harvest to reach new records. And that could mean cheaper food for consumers. Assuming the weather cooperates, the country could produce 48 million tons of corn, up 4.5 million tons. Globally, corn production will grow by 75 million tons, or 10 percent, to 946 million tons due to record crops in the United States, China, Brazil and Ukraine, according to the USDA.

I think the biggest thing I can do is earn their trust. I’ve said this before. I have the utmost confidence in myself. And I think what hinders me is the trust level between them and me. And I think the more I can earn their trust as a player, the more I can earn playing time. The fumble was just one of those plays when I saw the ball, and it was an opportunity for me to make a play and I made it.

Yet, even if levels of discomfort are similar among people, Hayek added: "The drugs don't work on 100 percent of the patients or 100 percent of the pain." Everyone builds up a tolerance to a pain drug, he explained, but this occurs more quickly with younger patients. Doctors need to keep this and other factors in mind when considering a course of action.

Sharing stage? 'Startling'
ST. LOUIS — After a second consecutive effort during which the Blackhawks came out listless and remained that way, captain Jonathan Toews said it wasn't yet time to worry.
The Rangers tied it in the sixth. Michael Young blooped a double to right, moved up on Murphy's long fly ball to center and scored on Cruz's single to left, which snapped an 0-for-14 slide. Travis Hafner's sacrifice fly in the bottom of the inning gave Cleveland the lead for good.

At Riva in Santa Monica, Fraiche's Jason Travi is zeroing in on the pizza front, too, taking his inspiration from the Italian Riviera. The crust has had some glitches, mostly in consistency, but he's been working on it. You can see the wood-burning oven just inside the open kitchen -- not a beauty, but functional. He's got a winner with his Molto Maiale pizza, which is very much in the Molto Mario (Batali) style: More has got to be better. This one is topped with meatballs, sausage, pancetta and bacon. There's a simple potato, Fontina and sea salt pie and a Margherita made with bufala mozzarella. Mushroom, though, seems more like duxelles spread thinly over the crust: not a success. He may be trying too hard to be original.

Heat the 1/3 cup olive oil over moderate heat in a large, wide, deep skillet or Dutch oven, preferably nonstick or enameled cast iron. It must be large enough to hold all the vegetables with the fish on top. Add the onion, fennel and potatoes. Season highly with salt and pepper and stir well. Saute, stirring often, until the potatoes are almost tender but not browned, about 20 minutes. Reduce the heat if necessary. Add the wine/saffron mixture, chickpeas, cilantro and 1 cup water. Put the tomatoes in a bowl and crush them well with your hands, then add them. Cover and cook at a gentle simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Put the fish on top of the bed of vegetables, cover and cook just until the fillets are white throughout and flake when probed with a fork, about 10 minutes.

A: I think certainly there's a window to profitability that you have to think about. And you need to be close to it. When we look out, it's one of these things where we're actually fairly close and we're in a good position. Should (an investor) be expected to look out four or five years? No, I think that's too far. With energy and cleantech, it might be more appropriate to look out two or three years.

The vote came largely along party lines, with 28 of the 30 Republicans voting for the bill and all but two of the Democrats voting against. House Republican Leader Kevin Cameron of Salem switched his vote from yes to no so he could be on the prevailing side.

"I will advocate for any tools the mayor wants to bring excellence to the Cleveland schools," Kasich told The Plain Dealer. "Frankly, a lot of what he wants is in Senate Bill 5. But I'm willing to move separate legislation. I've just got to find out exactly what he wants, what he would like to have.
Everything flows from the sly audacity of the premise -- rival champions who join forces to become the first male/male pair in figure-skating history. Mr. Ferrell's Chazz Michael Michaels is as frowzily macho as Mr. Heder's Jimmy MacElroy is ethereally fey. And though the plot twists that unite them are ingenious, the genius of the production, directed by Will Speck and Josh Gordon, lies in its performers, who play their ludicrous roles with fervent seriousness. (There's no way of knowing who did what with the script, which is credited to five writers: Craig Cox, Jeff Cox, Busy Philipps, John Altschuler and Dave Krinsky.)
No more. Now Napa has a bevy of top restaurants like La Toque and Ubuntu, plus tons of casual eating places, boutiques, theater, resorts and the Oxbow Public Market - its own take on San Francisco's Ferry Building.

The company has been struggling to put itself back together since February, when former Chief Executive Officer Michael Mendes and Chief Financial Officer Steven Neil were ousted in the wake of an internal audit revealing improper accounting of payments to walnut growers. Its planned $2.35 billion acquisition of Pringles from Procter & Gamble went up in smoke, and its stock price plummeted. At Monday's close, Diamond's stock was down 31 percent since the beginning of the year.

The Universal grinder was first designed in 1897, at which time it transformed the work of the cook by easing the effort required to chop meats and vegetables. The simple machine could grind 21/2 pounds of meat per minute, depending on the agility of the person turning the handle. It was nothing short of a marvel -- a food processor for the 19th century.

It's still a big gamble: Fashion fans, after all, are notoriously fickle. So why would any network take a chance on the genre?
Although a blended orgasm will offer a woman plenty of pleasure, the truth is that all orgasms are created equal. It is risky to suggest that one type of orgasm is better than another, or that women who don't reach vaginal orgasm easily are less sexually attune than women who do. Freud himself once described a clitoral orgasm as "immature," suggesting that vaginal orgasms are the true goal of sexual fulfillment. Talk about pressure! Women often have a hard enough time relaxing and enjoying sex without feeling like their natural responses are "immature" or not good enough.

anything resembling Oregon's fast-paced style and the speed it presents out of the backfield. Unlike Ohio State (2010 Rose Bowl) and Auburn (2011 BCS National Championship Game), the Badgers lack a dominant front four that can disrupt Oregon's running game. Once the Ducks get rolling on the ground, their no-huddle kicks into a high gear and the scoreboard operator begins experiencing finger cramps. In many ways, Wisconsin resembles Stanford's defense: Tough, hard nosed and smart. But both lack the foot speed to track down the likes of running backs LaMichael James, De'Anthony Thomas and Kenjon Barner. The Ducks defeated the Cardinal 53-30. Michigan State hung 471 yards of total offense on Wisconsin in the Big Ten championship game. Look for Oregon to produce about the same.

"We're all businessmen and get around by bike," says Slate Olson, general manager of Rapha in the U.S. "You want to feel like you could step into a meeting."
Moscoso's résumé works in his favor. He started 21 games last season for Oakland, so he won't be evaluated solely on spring training. Chatwood received a baptism by blowtorch last season with the Angels. If Rockies players were asked to pick the last starter, they'd go with Chatwood because his stuff is electric. But that also could translate into a power arm in the bullpen.
A freer currency market is the latest step from China's leaders to overhaul the country's financial system. Beijing has moved to bring the country's informal lending sector out of the shadows; has openly questioned the dominance of state-owned banks; and has eased its capital restrictions, amid complaints from both inside and outside the country that the financial system is inadequate to sustain the world's No. 2 economy.

If you read Wednesday's column, then you know I would believe it. My twin boys were born through IVF, and I was extremely offended by an effort that if left unchecked would have denied their birth, and in particular by some of the thoughtless rhetoric suggesting children born through such medical procedures are "manufactured" or "decanted."

Giusti's research on anthocyanins and other phytochemicals also involves the best way to process and store these compounds. She says one of the good things about the dark-colored juices is that you can immediately tell when their active components -- the anthocyanins usually -- have gone bad.

These days, you're not likely to encounter an unpleasant twang in the half-dozen or so pumpkin ales on the market. But you won't find much pumpkin, either.

It's not just a Generation Y problem. According to the New York Fed's report, 5.3 percent of the 37 million borrowers are age 60 and over, and another 11.8 percent are 50 to 59. This doesn't necessarily mean that boomers are going back to school (or still paying off their loans from the 1970s). Rather, it may be one sign that parents are increasingly taking out loans to pay for their kids' educations. According to a February report from the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys, 17 percent of parents whose children graduated in 2010 took out loans, up from 5.6 percent in 1992-93.

Meet the new face of the food cart revolution: Roving gastro-trucks that mash up ethnic cuisines, pop culture and affordability, then post their ever-shifting locations to a wired clientele through Twitter and Web sites. In Portland that means Koi Fusion, which launched in June when business grad Bo Kwon hit the streets in an $80,000 food truck with a spicy mix of Korean barbecue tacos, kimchi quesadillas and Korean fries. Now Kwon draws followers on the command of a tweet -- often to PGE Park or PSU but also renegade spots. And wherever Koi lands, the feel is of an instant party, fed by a communal condiment station and a great playlist. (Watch video here.)
passion that a game inspires in what are otherwise calm-and-collected human beings. It would explain the absolutely exhilirating ecstasy and the speechless despair that can simultaneously combust on a night like last night.

The Beavers scored three times – including their only two earned runs – in the bottom of the seventh. Tyler Smith walked to lead off the inning, then Conforto, in a curious bit of strategy considering he’s lapping the Pac-12 in RBI – tried to bunt.

“At that point I didn’t think it was beneficial for me or the team to go back and try to do anything,” Toews said. “It was just going to get worse at that point.

Air samplings along the south edge of the property, which is lined by houses, showed methane concentrations of 30 to 40 percent a couple of years ago, Schwarz said. Methane's explosive range is between 5 and 15 percent concentration; heavier than that and there isn't enough oxygen to sustain a fire, but the higher readings were still troubling. However, the most recent readings were "quite low," below 5 percent, and the methane extraction system is "working quite well," he says.

A study by the Department of Health and Human Services last year found that positive educational effects tend to wear off by the first grade. The government assistance she gets for financing college feeds into the maw of inexorable tuition increases. The chances that the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act is going to boost her pay, as a Web designer, are essentially nil. Julia is getting punked.

Shooting in San Francisco and Ann Arbor, cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe (who's worked with Pedro Almodovar) lends "The Five-Year Engagement" a lovely sheen, far easier on the eye than any previous Judd Apatow-produced comedy.

Segel and Blunt are enormously likable people on screen, armed with wide-eyed charm and stealthy timing. When the relationship at the movie's heart threatens to erode from within, you feel for both halves equally. And by the end, you realize how seldom this happens in this most devalued of genres.

Other ventures off-property included West End, the hip, dusty little town at the end of the island and a 15-minute drive from AKR. Although all meals were included in our dive package, we sometimes went for dinner at one of several excellent restaurants. Tongs Thai Island Cuisine was our favorite. The liveliest bar scene was at Sundowners, but that required leaving the kids behind on movie night. The shopping in West End erred toward the hippie: parachute silk pants, kites, wind chimes, that sort of thing, but the Lenca pottery, with beautiful black and white geometric designs made by Honduran highland women, was worth the drive.

-- Los Angeles Times: Neeson holds it together from first to last. He is the rumbly voiced king of the late-January/early February action film, per "Taken" and "Unknown," and by now moviegoers have been subliminally conditioned to pay money to hear that warm hearth of a speaking voice, under duress but coolly so, this time of year. Call "The Grey" "Deliverance"-lite, with snow, and wolves. And call it a solid January surprise.

There's a tendency to judge one period of time as preferable to another. I think it works more this way: Changing part of any system sends ripples through that system. B.C.

"The crew has to be super-vigilant. Imagine 1,500 miles of watching me and Julie ride a bike! And we're not going 60 miles per hour. We're going 10, or 15, or 20. Once we were waiting on a rider coming in and heard she was going three miles per hour at 3 in the morning. That's what she could do, so that meant her crew's car, right behind her, was going three miles per hour as well."
"The risk is the subplot that Michael Jackson's demise began when he got hurt on the Pepsi shoot," says youth consultant Marian Salzman. "So they need to have the thick skin to weather this." Even then, Salzman says, "He could be a great bridge between Pepsi Past and Pepsi Future."
Chandler refused to say if the incidents included associations with gamblers, but Durocher’s friends included actor George Raft, alleged to have worked at gambling clubs, and mobster Bugsy Siegel. The previous month, Durocher and Dodgers President Branch Rickey accused Yankees President Larry MacPhail — the former Dodgers president — of having two alleged gamblers, handicapper Memphis Engleberg and casino manager Connie Immerman, in his box during an exhibition game between the Dodgers and Yankees in Havana. MacPhail retaliated by filing a complaint with Chandler.

The flimsy plotting actually allows Hayes, Sasso and Diamantopoulus to impress with routines, vocal patter and mimicry that more than do justice to the memory of the original trio of Larry Fine, Curly Howard and Moe Howard. Alas, for every chuckle one of the new movie's numbskull moments might pry loose, there is an overlong urinating contest featuring infants in a maternity ward or curtain-closing goofiness with "the Farrellys" (played by soap opera actors) warning kids about the dangers of trying out actual stooge stunts at home.

Perot became a caricature, thanks to his own erratic behavior and comedian Dana Carvey's devastating portrayal. So it's easy to forget that in May 1992, the Texan led both incumbent George H.W. Bush and Clinton in the polls. The outrage Perot ignited -- at a time when the national debt was 48 percent of GDP versus today's 74 percent -- pushed both Clinton and the Republicans who seized Capitol Hill in 1994 toward a balanced budget.
Jefferson’s daughter, Natalie, 33, and two of her children, Shaquan Phillips, 15, and Angel Taylor, 2, escaped unharmed, as did Dietra Jackson, 42, and her daughter, Victoria Carden, 20, who live on the other side of the converted, 143-year-old farmhouse.
The chorus of Southeastern Conference fans after Oregon's 22-19 loss to Auburn in the title game was annoying. SEC fans wondered where the Ducks might have finished playing in a conference that featured more than one other contending team. I found that battle cry obnoxious and, maybe, a little disrespectful to West Coast football.

More than a dozen people on Thursday spoke in favor of Najarian's motion, including a representative for Assemblyman Anthony Portantino (D-La Cañada Flintridge) and La Cañada Mayor Don Voss, who said it would be "premature, inappropriate and fiscally irresponsible" to continue environmental studies on the roadway without identifying the overall cost.

Phoenix homicide investigators now are "well aware of the connection" between Drenth's death and his involvement in the off-duty misconduct investigation, Harris said.
The problem isn't just about the production of weapons and war machines. It's also about their sales. As they brace for some Pentagon cuts, U.S. military contractors hope to cover their losses by selling overseas, reinforcing the U.S. position as the world's No. 1 arms exporter. Just like Philip Morris, arms merchants are merchants of death. If they don't die in conflicts sustained by U.S. weapons, the victims die from inadequate health care, lack of food and potable water, unregulated environmental pollution, and all the other problems their governments should have been addressing instead of buying weapons.
Statewide, caseworkers have not responded to dozens of reports from the Child Abuse Hotline dating back to July and August. At least four of those reports in Maricopa County are high-priority cases, which require a response within two hours under state law.

Westfield UTC will kick off Thursday the first phase of what's envisioned as a $1 billion revitalization of its mall, a project approved three years ago by the San Diego City Council but delayed because of the recession.
"The notion that the fund's resources are on tap for Europe could become a self-fulfilling prophecy," said Cornell University economist Eswar Prasad, a former IMF official. The additional firepower, for which European nations lobbied heavily, "could give a sense of false comfort to European policy makers that they have done enough to fend off market pressures."
I was volunteering with Los Médicos Voladores (The Flying Doctors), which holds weekend clinics in medically underserved parts of Mexico. Besides medical volunteers, LMV welcomes translators, pilots and unskilled folks like me -- I learned to test for blood glucose levels a week before the trip.

He scored 14 or more points nine times, including a season-high 21 against East Carolina.
Bloomberg says the killing of the terrorist leader doesn't lessen the suffering Americans experienced at his hands the day the World Trade Center was destroyed but is a "critically important victory" for the nation.

Snow-covered fields along the road provided the perfect contrast to see a wolf in the distance. There are several wolf packs in the park, and they have proliferated since several dozen were captured in Canada and turned loose in 1995. But they are usually viewed only at dawn as they cross the valleys.
By the late 1990s, Mr. Williams realized that his job had changed. California's future was no longer tied to the broader economy, but to a small group of ultra-earners. To predict the state's revenue, he had to start forecasting the fortunes of the rich. That meant forecasting the performance of stocks—specifically, a handful of high-tech stocks.

All of these players are expected to be back for the summer. While most are fully confident Greene will back to 100% come August, he was such a tremendous impact player for the defense that there will always be some concern. The only player I worry about is Jefferson. Now entering his fifth and final season, Jefferson was beginning to come along last year. Hopefully an idle offseason won’t cause any conditioning issues as he will need to hit the field running to gain the trust of the new staff. It would have been great to have Johnson get the additional practice, especially with the move to LT (to be discussed later). However, with the talent and athleticism that allowed him to rise up the depth charts he should be able to easily catch up.

And because he gives a fair chance to everything he’s sent, no matter how humble the packaging looks, his show has become required listening for anybody interested in the New York City underground. While Russo plays cuts by major label acts — he was the first deejay in the country to spin Pearl Jam’s 2009 single "Just Breathe" — his heart belongs to the true independent artists. Russo is community-minded, and he takes his commitment to airing music alternatives seriously. While he didn’t initially know how to transform that mission into action on "Anything Anything," he feels like he’s now on the right track.

Curley said he had become interested in Kennedy's story shortly after becoming AP's president, while helping with work on the company history "Breaking News: How The Associated Press Has Covered War, Peace, and Everything Else," which described the firing.

Colson's outspokenness on behalf of that last group, along with his forceful defense of man-woman marriage and rebukes of everything from moral relativism and aggressive secularism to the spread of euthanasia and Internet pornography, ranked as scandalous in many minds as his Nixon-era offenses. His refusal to bow to the gods of political correctness probably explains why Beltway pundits who easily forgave Ted Kennedy and Bill Clinton their misdeeds never could accept the authenticity of a rehabilitated Chuck Colson.
It's a seat close to Democrats' hearts, still raw from their humiliating loss to the upstart Brown in 2010.

With spring comes the promise of garden tomatoes, if we're patient. Perhaps we needn't be as patient as in the past, though. Bushel Boy Farms in Owatonna, Minn., this week released its newest variety, a beefsteak tomato that comes mighty close in flavor and appearance to what comes off our back-yard vines. "Bushel Boy Bubbas" are grown in special greenhouses, pollinated by bees, then ripened and shipped on the vine to stores within about 24 hours of being picked. They're available in most Twin Cities grocery stores.
"If the ball goes into the sun, what can you do?" Darvish said through an interpreter.
But problems loom in Columbus. Democrats fear the political clout of teachers unions. And for some Republicans, anything that demands positive results from their deep-pocketed contributors in the charter school crowd makes them skittish. Just last year, House Speaker Bill Batchelder unsuccessfully tried to slip into the state budget a provision allowing the creation of taxpayer-financed schools with little government oversight, whose primary purpose would have been to turn a profit for their owners.
Sunnis blame Shiites for supporting the brutal Shiite-allied regime, and Shiites fear what could happen to them if the uprising succeeds.

At one time, he only had second-hand knowledge of this. His own dad — the first Henry, and the grandfather of Giants fullback Henry Hynoski Jr. — was a poignant example: A star linebacker during the Depression, he was offered a scholarship to play at Fordham during the Lombardi years. But his mother, a widow just off the boat from Poland, incapable of grasping what it all meant, had other plans: Her son was going to work to help support the family, and the only place to do that was in the mines.

But it's the fraught relationships between the crooks and their molls and/or wives that pad the action and diffuse the film's potential tension. Only Boyd's rocky marriage to the radiant, long-suffering Doreen (an excellent Kelly Reilly) is worth its emotional close-up, despite a stock trajectory.
In the fall of 2009, the pair made four trips to Mexico to buy one or two kilos of heroin at a time, Bement said.

Indeed, much of "West Cross Timbers," Shires’ first solo record, felt as indebted to Willa Cather and Eudora Welty as it does to Emmylou Harris or Dolly Parton. "Carrying Lightning," a collection of love stories, simply seems like the diary entries of a woman whose wanderlust is barely contained by her small town circumstances. Shires, who takes her lyrics as seriously as any prose writer, often uses assignments and exercises to spark her creativity.

Butterfield considers himself "a pretty good student," currently immersed in photography and music (he plays piano, guitar and drums) as well as the usual subjects during the one-hour-of-work, one-hour-of-school on-set schedule. That helped when Scorsese gave him "homework" as well — movies to watch to familiarize himself with the early-film era that concerns "Hugo," and other movies that inspired the director. No studying, however, could prepare Butterfield for the emotional demands of playing an orphan sustaining himself in a Parisian train station.

No. The worst that could happen if all cooling stopped is that the fuel would melt and fall to the floor of the containment vessel. The containment vessel is designed to hold the hot fuel in, but the type of nuclear reactor in danger at the Fukushima plant —General Electric Mark One boiling water reactors — has been widely reported to have a vulnerability in its design that would let the fuel burn through the floor of the vessel. If that happened, radiation could spread through the environment, but on a much more limited basis than happened at Chernobyl, where there was no containment vessel and the core contained graphite that burned, dispersing radioactivity widely. A massive plume of radioactive smoke and ash could spread from the site, exposing people for miles away, depending on the wind and weather.

Suddes lamented the loss of rebels who he says are being shown the door due to term limits. I would submit that a more likely culprit of legislative ills and fewer rebels is the aggressive actions taken by both the Republican and Democratic parties to handpick candidates and involve themselves in primaries to ensure their guy or gal wins.

European paper wasps are often mistaken for wasps or yellowjackets, but are actually beneficial predators of caterpillars and other insects.

Insecticides are effective on active nests, but apply at night or early morning. More at ext.colostate.edu/pubs/ insect/05525.html

Casino gambling was promoted in 1992 for the historic mining towns of Black Hawk, Central City and Cripple Creek, with proceeds promised to historic preservation there and across the state.

You don't have to be a purist to think that's not truly historic preservation.

Drawing on bills crafted by the council, on New Jersey legislation and dozens of e-mails by Christie staffers and others, The Star-Ledger found a pattern of similarities between ALEC’s proposals and several measures championed by the Christie administration. At least three bills, one executive order and one agency rule accomplish the same goals set out by ALEC using the same specific policies. In eight passages contained in those documents, New Jersey initiatives and ALEC proposals line up almost word for word. Two other Republican bills not pushed by the governor’s office are nearly identical to ALEC models.

I think it was because I am an only child. In a way I always felt a child -- too much into myself. I worried I wouldn't be ready to give myself.

I was lucky to get pregnant at 44. We didn't have to try for a long time. It was natural.

On the surface, "Through," a premiere, might seem to be of the same order as "Swipe." Cong is the resident choreographer of the Tulsa Ballet and, like Caniparoli, a hybridizer, taking from various idioms to forge a contemporary ballet. But Cong, with a pastiche of music compositions by Ryuichi Sakamoto that became increasingly schmaltzy, and despite obvious talent, lacks Caniparoli's capacity to layer. He tends toward the sentimental and superficial, like Smuin, but unlike Smuin, the pas de deux are mechanical and virtuosic, not emotive, reducing "Through's" abundant circles, lifts and leaps to pyrotechnics. While the rich action was always moving somewhere, it lacked the depth that makes us feel the human poetry of motion.

If you feel faint, cross your legs and tense your leg, abdominal and buttock muscles when warning symptoms first appear. The resulting blood pressure boost may stave off the faint or at least give you time to get to a safe place. Intense hand-gripping and tensing of the arm muscles can also help. If possible, lie down, ideally with your legs elevated, before you fall down. These simple measures can help keep you from adding the insult of injury to the discomfort of feeling faint.
District Judge Peter Sheridan noted that there is not much guidance on this issue. Nevertheless, Judge Sheridan did indicate that “the policy behind the provision envinces an intent to deter the abuse of life estates within the transfer of asset rules”. Judge Sheridan denied Mr. Traister’s application for the preliminary injunction. This case is still pending before the Federal District Court. This federal court decision demonstrates the reluctance of courts to allow the life estate transaction where the individual has not lived at the property for at least one year from the date of the purchase of the life estate interest as required by federal statute.

He later altered a public statement to remove the term, after receiving advice that it could open him up to legal trouble, according to the report.

Patsos is nothing if not a liberal user of his bench players. When I go to Reitz, I try to sit behind the home bench, which affords me the opportunity to see the coach at work. For Patsos, at work means quickly yanking players out of the game, yelling at an assistant coach about said player’s performance while the player sits next to the assistant coach, then putting the player back in a minute later. During one early-season game, he subbed out all five starters within the first two minutes of the game, only to put them all back in a few plays later. That said …

A: Hey, Brian: Massaquoi missed a lot of work, but the good news is he worked with McCoy and the other skill position players in the four Camp Colts during the lockout. So he's not coming in entirely out of the cold. I think he will benefit from the switch to the West Coast system. As for Pinkston, we will only find out during the regular-season games. I do think the Browns will be looking for a guard with experience -- just in case. Billy Yates would look real good right now.

Pujols' embrace of the Angels may have stunned much of the fan base he leaves behind but represented an almost predictable ending to a two-year process that began shortly after the club signed left fielder Matt Holliday to a franchise record $120 million contract in January 2010. Anticipated talks about an extension for Pujols failed to materialize following his third MVP season, allowing market forces to further complicate the process.

One of the biggest reasons The X Factor is such a hit in The United Kingdom is the judging panel.

In the one-liner category, the show displays a taxidermy kitten that stands upright in a display case and brandishes a placard declaring, "I'm Dead." Created by English artist David Shrigley, the piece draws a contrast between the cuddly appeal of a stuffed animal and a blunt verbal message. Dark, cynical humor -- with a sophomoric edge -- is definitely part of being human.

The cocktail program, which this season is at play with ciders, nectars and syrups, is exemplary, but the somewhat incoherent wine list could easily be rearranged to work better for the diner.

The strangest situation was when I was stopped for speeding by the notoriously corrupt police. When the officer pulled me over, I pretended I didn't understand Spanish, hoping he might give up and just let me go. I ended up going native. I gave the officer enough money to treat himself and his senora to a steak dinner, then was allowed to go on my way. Of course, no ticket was issued. It was both frightening and amusing.

Today, you can hardly log onto the Web without running across stories detailing the wreckage and waste wrought by the green jobs fantasy. The Solyndra scandal, in which half a billion dollars in loan guarantees was funneled to a now-bankrupt solar panel maker, is still unreeling.

To prepare the tart shell: Preheat the oven to 350°. Place a piece of wax paper or baking parchment on top of the pie dough in the pan and fill with pie weights or dry beans.

Hoskins directed "The Raggedy Rawney" (1988), a unique treatise on war and family in which a young soldier (Dexter Fletcher) deserts his post, poses as a mute woman and joins a band of Gypsies. The period seems vaguely World War II-ish, and the country vaguely European, but the military is far from heroic, terrorizing civilians, stealing their supplies and virtually kidnapping their young men. Hoskins plays Darky, leader of the Gypsies, whose objective is to keep the tribe on the move — and free — at all costs.

The St. Louis Chamber Chorus will perform a program of classics by the likes of Bach, Gesualdo and Purcell that have been finished or reconstructed by scholars and composers including Stravinsky and John Rutter. As usual, the venue has been chosen to match the music, and this one is a standout in a lot of ways: St. Alphonsus Liguori "Rock" Roman Catholic Church, itself beautifully reconstructed after a lightning strike to the church roof caused a five-alarm fire in 2007.

Romney: Opposes legal recognition of same-sex marriage and says it should be banned with a constitutional amendment, not left to states. "Marriage is not an activity that goes on within the walls of a state." Also opposes civil unions "if they are identical to marriage other than by name," but says states should be left to decide what rights and benefits should be allowed under those unions. Says certain domestic partnership benefits _largely unspecified — as well as hospital visitation rights are appropriate but "others are not." Says he would not seek to restore the ban on openly gay military members. Asserted in 2002 campaign for Massachusetts governor that "all citizens deserve equal rights, regardless of sexual preference," in tune with statements years earlier as a Senate candidate that equality for gays and lesbians should be a "mainstream concern." But did not explicitly support marriage recognition and, as governor, opposed same-sex marriage when courts legalized it in Massachusetts. "My view is that marriage itself is between a man and a woman."

ø8. Philadelphia Eagles: All too often, the center of their defense proved the Achilles' heel in 2011. Coach Andy Reid clearly seems to understand that and traded up in Round 1 for highly regarded DT Fletcher Cox. After previously acquiring MLB DeMeco Ryans, Reid continued investing in the second level by getting Mychal Kendricks in Round 2 before landing another top-notch pass rusher in Vinny Curry. Fourth-round CB Brandon Boykin may even stem the loss of Asante Samuel. Dream Team part deux?

In Santa Clara County, where 87,000 acres of mostly undeveloped wilderness were set aside for Henry W. Coe State Park, a three-year agreement was reached between the state and a new nonprofit group, the Coe Park Preservation Fund. Here the landscape alternates between open mountain ridges and steep canyons; grassland and chaparral in scenic hills; and riparian habitats along creeks. The open countryside bursts into wonderful spring wildflower displays, while a combination of live and blue oaks and big berry manzanita provide shade. With its 250 miles of trails and many small lakes, this park is popular with hikers, bikers, backpackers and anglers willing to hike to its remote lakes. Ridge-top Coe Ranch Campground offers fantastic views, with shade provided by shady oaks or shade ramadas.

This car might be your worst nightmare. A plug-in hybrid electric luxury sedan that costs more than $100,000, from a California company—Orange County, but still—which has borrowed $169 million from taxpayers as part of the Department of Energy's advanced-vehicle-technology loan program; a car built not in the heartland but the socialist paradise of Finland; a car that, with the arithmetic all in, averages 52 mpg-e (that's the EPA's metric for plug-in hybrid EVs), which means that for all its fancy-dancy lithium-iron-phosphate star drive, it gets about the same fuel economy as a conventional Prius hybrid.

It was the start of the home stretch, and Gov. Jon Corzine had him on the ropes, charging that the challenger, who supported no-frills insurance policies, was anti-woman and anti-mammogram.
In high school, I immersed myself in the school newspaper, a broadcasting class and the yearbook project, so when I started college I enrolled in journalism and mass communication classes. It was hard work, but it rarely felt like it because I loved it so. Similarly, I would urge Gerald to enroll in college classes that mirrored his favorite high-school subjects and passions.
"I just think defensive guys think more team, and don't feel like they invented the game of football," said Northwestern's Pat Fitzgerald, a former All-American linebacker at his school. "I've met a lot of offensive guys that think they invented it, and that's OK. It's two sides of the fence. That's what makes it so fun."
"When you look how we ended the season, once we got Baron, he seemed to galvanize the team and we started playing more like a team. You put a healthy Anderson in there, and a healthy Jamison, and you're pretty competitive.

Earlier this year, he enrolled in Goodwill's 18-week Flip the Script program, led by Bennett. He'll graduate this month and start looking for a job -- one he hopes will provide meaning and purpose. Flip focuses on math skills, domestic violence, male accountability, financial literacy, fatherhood and preparing for work.
“The perception of things — it plays an incredible role,” he says. “Because sometimes the reality is quite different. In America, I have done horror movies, action films, cult films, social movies. I have been on Broadway, in ‘Nine.’ I have directed films. I don’t think there is a male actor in the world who has played more gay characters than I have. But it doesn't matter what I do — I am still the Latin lover.”

"From what I saw, the players are looking forward to revisiting the things we did well last year and making improvements on the things that we didn't do well," said Shurmur. "You get to work with some of the new coaches and some of the new players. For me, I just have a much better view of what our team is and the areas we need to improve in to get ourselves in a position to play in the playoffs and compete to play in the big game. And I think that's what we're looking to do."
She said, when he returns, they will take a vacation to Jamaica — the honeymoon they haven't had yet.
Combine the onions, carrots, chilies, ginger, bay leaves, peppercorns and water in a medium pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, add the chicken thighs, and simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Add the chicken breasts and simmer for another 10 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.
As good as most of the sampler was, the entrees were an upgrade. Bubba's patented boneless pork sparerib steak was a wonder of moist, tender, smoky goodness. Batter-crusted sweet potato fries were crunchy outside, fluffy and sweet inside. A juicy, whole smoked chicken looked like more than enough to satisfy any 300-pound lineman. Our dining companion's St. Louis ribs also scored a touchdown with their moist, meaty goodness. Try to get there early on the weekend. But if you can't, Bubba's is worth the wait. -- Bob Migra, Special to The Plain Dealer

"I don't think there are any guarantees in this situation, from what it sounds like," he said. "He really needs to come in and prove not only to the coaching staff, but to the players that he's really a changed guy- not only in spring training or that first month of the season, but he's got to carry that over through the rest of the season. That's the big thing. That's going to be a huge thing, trust-wise, for the players and the organization, to see if this is going to be a long term thing."

As logging industrialized, poor men became rich, and a rich landscape became poor. After arriving in America in 1852 as an 18-year-old German immigrant, Frederick Weyerhaeuser later controlled a logging empire valued at $70 million. Apart from canny purchasing of timberlands around the Great Lakes, his masterstroke was forming a syndicate of formerly rival lumber companies. By breaking logjams of wood being floated down the Mississippi, everyone's production improved; at the same time, cut land around the Great Lakes became a tinderbox. In 1871, Wisconsin's Peshtigo fire seared 2,000 square miles and claimed more than a thousand lives. In the Badger State alone, more fires followed in 1891, 1894, 1897, 1908, 1910, 1923, 1931 and 1936. "Losing half a million acres in a year was almost commonplace," Rutkow observes.

It will be up to Nixon to appoint a successor, most likely one of the other two Democratic commissioners, Kevin Gunn or Robert Kenney.
Nonetheless, this administration seems intent upon using the civilian legal system rather than designating caught-in-the-act terrorists as enemy combatants. I think it's a mistake, but they will be in power for almost three more years, possibly seven. In the interim, therefore, we have to think about how to adapt this administration's preferred domestic-judicial model to the real world.
According to the information, Coyne also ran a fraud beginning in March in which he invited an investor to invest in a new Krispy Kreme doughnut franchise in Brunswick.

"Japanese mobile-game platforms are incredibly profitable, and you don't find similar business models anywhere else in the world because they evolved in Japan's unique cellphone culture and network environment," says SMBC Friend Research Center analyst Mitsuru Miyazaki.

The third quarter results were hurt by declines in investment banking and trading from its Merrill Lynch division, which has been an income generator in previous quarters.

Former President George W. Bush, who was in office on the day of the attacks, issued a written statement hailing bin Laden's death as a momentous achievement.

The Browns wanted Trent Richardson and knew the Vikings wouldn't take a running back. But they didn't know what team might trade for the third pick and steal Richardson, or how far Spielman was willing to trade down, so the Browns were willing to give up a few of their stockpiled picks.
Exceptions to the rule
Tonight’s episode showed us a glimmer of Emily’s heart when she took back the DVD that would have revealed David Clarke as Charlotte’s father. Aside from this moment, however, it was hard to believe that there was any feeling inside her. Her lack of compassion for Jack and Amanda, as well as her complete disregard for Nolan’s warnings make it seem as if she is also manipulating the Jack situation. Yes, Amanda out of the picture works out for Emily’s ultimate revenge plot, but it also leaves Jack able to continue to pine.

The menu at this new spot features mainstays of the original Hungry Cat's menu — marinated peel 'n' eat shrimp, the hefty pug burger, etc. But here, with a generously sized kitchen with plenty of elbow room, Lentz has more room to indulge himself with specials. For the most part, they take an exotic Asian or Middle Eastern bent. That's explained by the fact that before moving to L.A., Lentz was executive chef at China Grill in Las Vegas.

Now, Oregon will tell you that it believes it has the greatest talent pool around. But the Ducks -- who haven't had a first-round selection since Jonathan Stewart in 2008 -- don't. And what we've learned in the past three seasons by watching the success on the field fail to translate into high-caliber NFL picks is that Kelly doesn't need all the best players to win big. He doesn't even need a half dozen of them. He just needs some pretty good football players, and maybe, a small number of guys who have a chance to play in the NFL someday.

The two left El Salvador — which was probably for the best — and landed in Nicaragua. "The two countries were nothing alike," she writes. "El Salvador was your basic mail-order military dictatorship: terror and torture, stuttering civilians. Nicaragua was more like a cheerful Communist kazoo concert." With supplies for the Sandinista regime coming from the Soviet Union, left-leaning foreigners — Internacionalistas, they were called — flocked to the country, some lending real support, some holding inappropriately festive rallies.

"MDE's objection wasn't to the family, it was to Mr. Cunningham being involved," said Gorski. "In 2004, if MDE wasn't satisfied he wasn't involved and it was a separate entity, we would never had gotten this far in this process. You cannot judge the daughter based on what MDE found about the father in the late 1990s. This is a whole different type of operation. The reality is he's 75 years old, he's not in the landfill business. He's retired and he races his cars."

Some things have changed, of course. Gone are stables for guests' horses; the school, movie theater, billiard room and bowling alley that were once downstairs; and fox hunts that were staged in nearby barren hills. There have also been financial ups and downs. The Great Depression forced the hotel to close in 1933 and reopen 10 months later under the ownership of Bank of America before being sold again later, according to Anderson's book.

Well, it's important to keep developers happy and faithful in your up-and-coming OS. But really, you're meant to be assuring the people who are now locked into two-year AT&T contracts. Most of these people are eagerly showing off Windows Phone to their friends. Why would you want the last line of this endorsement to be "But for God's sake, don't buy one: Microsoft will release a major update in the fall and only new phones will run it. In fact, you might want to give Windows Phone a miss entirely, if their ongoing policy is to deny their existing users access to future OS features."

Fiat announced earlier this month that it would go ahead with €700 million investment in the Pomigliano plant despite opposition by one union that opposes labor concessions sought by Fiat.

Three out of four jobs in high-tech industries aren't in high-tech occupations, the CSU study showed. Those jobs include administrative support, sales, financial operations and production.
Could the incident have taken place earlier this summer, before the TSA's pilot program started? Probably. Maybe the fact that it happened after the test started, and that a celebrity with a well-read blog was involved, shone a spotlight on behavior screening.

3) Early lead. It’s not a stretch to say that every team enjoys taking an early lead as it allows them to control the game’s tempo and be patient on offense. But ESPN analyst and former Johns Hopkins All-American goalkeeper Quint Kessenich said jumping out early would be more beneficial for the Blue Jays than Loyola. “I think the early lead is extremely important because Johns Hopkins as a team has proven that they’re not built to come back from behind,” Kessenich said. “They’re just not that quick on defense. You saw them fall behind Navy and when Navy spread them out and attacked them with their quick players, Hopkins lacked a certain quickness on defense. If the Blue Jays fall behind, that does not cater to their defensive strengths.”

The Condos live just down the river from Yasuni National Park's riverbank clay licks. That's where thousands of parrots congregate daily to eat mineral-laden clay. They don't always show up, leaving some tourists feeling shortchanged, as if a lodge can orchestrate nature like a virtual reality concert. But we're in luck. Hundreds of green bodies stand out like florescent targets on the beige clay walls. They squawk. They flutter. They gnaw at the clay. It's happy hour at Moe's Bar.

Wien is calling for oil to fall to $85 a barrel, for gold to return to $1,800 or for stocks to surpass 1,400 as measured by the S&P 500. Some of these would seem to be mutually exclusive. It's very hard to imagine 3 percent U.S. growth and $85 crude happening simultaneously. But Wein isn't saying all 10 predictions will come true. He's saying that many of these are likely to happen.

It remains to be seen if Motte can hold up over the long haul as closer. He has the mindset and the fastball. He still needs better secondary stuff. What happens when the season's wear and tear takes some mph off his heater. He is still a work in progress. Lance Lynn or Eduardo Sanchez could become better closer options IF they gain command to go with their "plus" stuff.

The militants, believed to be followers of former jihadist groups, lie at the outer edge of the Islamist movement. More mainstream Islamists gained instant empowerment when Mubarak's regime was toppled by a popular uprising. Led by the powerful Muslim Brotherhood and the ultraconservative Salafis, these Islamists long ago abandoned violence and supported peaceful change toward an Islamic state.
Enter Frost -- literally. After conducting some nefarious business and escaping assassins in a chaotic chase scene, Frost turns himself in to the U.S. Consulate. A man whom the government has been seeking for nine years deposits himself on the doorstep.

In every case I was given a brief history about the bottling, and on one visit Lynch suggested the 2006 Cavallotto, a wine from Piedmont made with the Freisa grape (it retails for about $22).

Those kids are all in their mid-40s now, and you know what? They haven't changed a bit. At least, that's what the authors of a new study on the kids, published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, say.
At least up until now, Best Buy has resisted some of the Black Friday creep, allowing its fans to sleep in a bit more by opening its doors at 5 a.m. last year. (But of course, some eager beavers still camped out to be the first in line.) So it will be interesting to see if it joins the fray and opens earlier this year, too.

“It was shown on Channel 5 on a weekend,” said West, “and then nothing happened.” The film was shot on 16 mm over several weekends in Wadsworth during the fall of 1972. The budget: $13,000. It follows the plight of a young boy named Scotty (Tom Kelly) whose father and step-mother (Donald E. Murray and Marji Dodrill) are kind of grouchy and don’t have much time for him. Tommy and his friends fall in with a creepy church janitor, who instructs them on how to rid the world of grown-ups.
Our founding fathers understood society inherently contains strong anti-democratic forces and provided us with a remedy in these times of crisis. We can amend our constitution and right our democracy. To do so is as American as America itself. We have done it before, 12 times in the 20th century, three of them overturning unpopular U.S. Supreme Court decisions.

Terri Frohnmayer, 55, of Salem, who is nicknamed "Little Bit," was a giant-killer in defeating Mina Hardin, 51, of Fort Worth, Texas, and winning the USGA Senior Women's Amateur at the 5,876-yard, par-72 Honors Course in Chattanooga, Tenn.
The West Portal strip has plenty of grown-up attractions - in the form of friendly neighborhood pubs. And they all have quintessential bar names: The Dubliner, Joxer Daly's and perhaps best of all, the Philosopher's Club. The closest you'll get to mixology in West Portal is a gin and tonic. And in this case, that's a very good thing.

Being a part of his eighth minor-league team — for the first time in management — and facing what could be long odds to make it go doesn't faze Armstrong. The son of a Canadian navy man, Armstrong played 17 seasons of pro hockey before retiring from the St. Louis Blues organization in 2010.
"You walk into any classroom, and there are automatic routines - you can tell by how kids walk the hallways, how they enter the classrooms," Johnstone said. "It's not, 'I can wear a hood in Ms. Johnstone's class but not in Ms. Smith's class.' Everybody's on the same page. We have the same vision, and we come up with it together."
On other visits the menu highlighted salmon ($18.50) topped with artichoke hearts and a mince of ham, onions and carrots so precisely cubed as to elevate the dish to haute status. The chef places the fillet on a thin veneer of onion puree that adds yet another element of interest. Another night he tops the salmon with a stew of leeks accented with caraway vinaigrette.

One team moved the ball well and it wasn’t the Cavs. Coach Byron Scott was imploring his club to make the extra pass to locate the open teammate and it didn’t happen near enough. The Cavs finished with a season-low 10 assists and shot 37.8 percent from the field. Irving finished 6-of-15 from the field. Alonzo Gee was 3-of-12. Tristan Thompson 5-of-13. Lots of ugly numbers.

Good thing the Pacers are not playing the Knicks.
After the Dolphin Plunge, we all grabbed floats and took a trip on Loggerhead Run, a lazy river that takes you past the dolphin tank slowly enough so the kids could finally see them.

Two weeks earlier, on Aug. 29, my father's B-17 had been downed by German fighters. He, too, parachuted out safely and was taken to Barth.

Those parts were all well and good. I can understand why unmarried people without kids see those next steps as life-ending rather than life-affirming. I myself was once petrified of having a child, and it wasn't so long ago that I wouldn't even head out the door until 10 p.m.

"Thank God for my wading boots, as there unfortunately is broken glass as well. Every single back eddy had trash floating in it," he said. "(Crawford's) biggest piece was an x-large Styrofoam ice chest with the end smashed off. It's pretty obvious that McDonald's and Subway both offer what must be considered prime river-food as their packaging is mixed in at most places. The other thing is there are as many cans and bottles underwater as there are on the banks! The bottom of the river in sections off of premium shore access is literally covered with cans and bottles."

When combined with other charges - for providing the RAL in cash, or transferring it to a high-fee prepaid card - the cost of the RAL can approach loan-shark levels. During last year's tax season, Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc. was blocked from selling RALs after the Office of the Comptroller of Currency prohibited the company's bank from financing the program. In December, federal regulators similarly cut off RAL lending for H&R Block Inc., the nation's biggest tax-prep firm.

Located 11 miles from the Chilean coast, bathed in cool breezes and morning fogs from the chilly Pacific Ocean, the Casablanca Valley was once thought too cold for growing wine grapes.

And it is exactly because of events that defy our understanding of reality-like devastating tornadoes here in Missouri, or even more deadly in Alabama-that we lean on ritual to give shape to what feels like a shapeless existence. Think of the way we made sense of last week's tornadoes here in St. Louis within the context of

Blintzes, the Jewish pancakes that wrap around a sweet or savory filling, are equivalent to crepes, although they probably originated in Poland, and the name derives from Russian blini. We know blini as tiny, thin pancakes used to prop up caviar and creme fraiche, but they had their start in the Middle Ages as buckwheat disks and evolved over the centuries into more refined creations lightened up with yeast and whipped egg whites.

Earlier in the discussion, Hoehn tried to split the issue into two votes. He motioned to vote on just the ball fields for $1.9 million, then on the bus lot for $500,000.

Yes, a Security Council resolution could be useful if it helps smooth the rough transition out of tyranny — not only in post-Assad Syria, but across the Arab world. But Washington has now spent months getting us here — handing the lead to the Europeans, who promptly put the Gulf Arabs in front (albeit, some say, while still pulling the strings).

"Once we got going as a group, James really factored into the game with his size and speed," Laviolette said. "He hadn't had at that point a whole lot of competition, even in drills and practice.

øUnless the rules of capitalism are suspended, eventually, Apple will encounter a rival that's able to take it on. If that happens, using Apple stock as an ATM will cease to work. And that's why your strategy seems to be setting you up for trouble. Remember that Apple stock can correct, especially considering how rapidly it's risen. If there's any disruption in the company's business, a severe downturn in the stock would be expected.

The stark reality of politics is that there is no such thing anymore as a solo candidate. Every candidate has a family.

I was left with pounds of leftover grilled eggplant after a photo shoot, and although eggplant is my favorite vegetable, grilling it is my least-favorite preparation. Without breading and frying the eggplant, I worried that the dish would be soggy and lack form. I layered the bread crumbs with the eggplant to give the vegetable that familiar breaded flavor and a little crunch. I proceeded with my usual preparation, minus some cooking time, and the result was remarkably close to the original.

MH: Books about the Templars fall into two categories. Some are strictly history and confine themselves to the two centuries of the Templars' existence. Others are speculative and deal in the many stories surrounding the Templars, in what you might call the afterlife of the Templars that continues in the popular imagination to this day. I wanted to take a serious look at both the history and the mythic afterlife and to show how they are intimately related and always have been -- how the Templars became the subject of popular imagination already at their inception, celebrities, you might say, the superstars of the Middle Ages.

Answer: I think the significant part about what Secretary Gates has put on the table and what we have executed is not necessarily a cut of the defense budget but rather taking a look at our budget and then challenging the services to reinvest or realign. I welcome that. And for the Navy it's important because we're heavily involved ashore in the Middle East, in Iraq, Afghanistan. We have 14,500 sailors ashore, more than the about 10,000 we have at sea. Many of those sailors ashore come from San Diego and commands around San Diego. That's about the same amount of sailors that we have committed to the fight as the Marine Corps has committed to the fight. That said, we still believe that because of our global interests, the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean/Arabian Gulf region require continued attention and continued presence and that we in the Navy are the force that best provides that presence and that attention. And we've stayed true to that even as we're dealing with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And what we have been able to do is to take that opportunity for realignment and reinvestment and address some of the structure issues and capability issues that allow us to, I think, better provide that presence and better provide the nation with options in those important parts of the world.

No wonder.

For instance, on June 29, Cincinnati's 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals turned back a challenge, originating in Michigan, to the Patient Protection law's coverage requirement. A three-judge panel ruled that the mandate falls within the Commerce Clause of the Constitution; issues might be raised by how the new law is applied, but on paper, the judges saw no constitutional bar. The final word on that, of course, will come from the U.S. Supreme Court.

But it was the dancing, so to speak, that did him in. During last Saturday night’s performance, Sosko injured his knee during the first act, in a scene in which McMurphy hops off of a chair and jumps around with the other patients in the mental hospital (the “cuckoo’s nest”) celebrating an imaginary home run on the TV. After limping through another couple of performances, though, Sosko was put on the disabled list.

If one person's experiences were enough to prove that healthy habits ensure a long and vigorous life, Hempel would be the toast of the medical community. Through a mix of wise choices, natural inclination and random chance, she seems to have followed just about every bit of standard advice on living to a healthy old age -- and has achieved impressive results. Of course anecdotal evidence only goes so far, and not everybody is equally lucky. But to some extent, Hempel has created her own luck.

A SteriPen water purifier has long been a must-have on multi-day river trips and desert hikes, but my one complaint has been the batteries — if you're at all environmentally conscious, the idea of tossing out those four lithium AAs, even as long as they last, can be tougher to stomach than a glassful of protozoan cysts.

In a statement, disciplinarian Brendan Shanahan said one of the factors that went into the decision to limit punishment to a fine was that Weber's action was reactionary.

I am sure by now everybody even remotely close to surfing has heard the horrible news about the death of three-time World Surfing Champion Andy Irons. I have been buried by emails suggesting I write something about this. My deadline for doing these columns is one week before they come out, so today is a week ago and this just happened day before yesterday. At this moment I, and probably many others, are thinking "How did such a bad thing happen to this young guy?"
But that's OK, because in my haste to avoid consuming more teriyaki, I chose to go with the wild mushroom fried rice with black truffle oil instead. It's a fairly large bowl, where fluffy mounds of grain waft puffs of earthy truffle perfume. Again, at $16, with nary a shaving of real black truffle in sight, there is very little value to be had unless you are served a wheelbarrow of the stuff.
Stanley Goldman, a professor at Loyola Law School, called Goodkin's involvement in Coppola's project "a great birthday present for the defense."
"I complained to the commissioners, but they wouldn't do anything about it," he said. He said that at the time he believed Russo's effort was a place to stash hires.

Obama also met Monday with volunteers for President Barack Obama's re-election campaign. Colorado and Arizona, where she was traveling later Monday, are key states in the presidential election.
Smith does a nice job with a very tricky, schematic character — an unreconstructed racist whose disdain for the hotel’s Indian staff transforms when she bonds with a maid over their shared life histories as marginalized domestic workers. Nighy and Wilton also work to deepen a potentially shallow depiction of the henpecked man joined to a shrew of a wife — in gesture and in tone, Nighy shows that he understands he’s failed to give her the life she’s expected, and Wilton shows us a woman who let disappointment turn to anger and reproach. In a crucial scene, we see the disintegrated couple remember being in love, and it’s a nice moment.
But none of those changes addressed what a panel of outside financial experts has styled "the elephant in the room" for California's proposed high-speed rail system – its extraordinarily low projected operating costs.
"Each one's different," Stewart said, adding that he believed if Mizzou had defeated Michigan, "I think we would have been in the Final Four a number of times, because there wasn't anything we did once that we didn't then do multiple times."
FSU freshman Luke Weaver entered in a similar situation, taking the mound in the sixth inning to relieve starter Mike Compton (7-0). Compton's outing was noteworthy, because he had only made it to the third inning in his two previous starts.

The author's personal engagement with this material gives punch to his conclusion: "Carnegie's presuppositions also point to depressing aspects of the American system, which values success over sincerity, individualism over community. . . . Carnegie just assumes (unconsciously) that he is dealing with a world of pathological narcissists" -- a regrettably apt description of modern America at its worst.
Addiction can take hold in as little as two weeks, he said, and women face the daunting task of detoxifying -- a physical struggle, as withdrawal can lead to rapid pulse and breathing, high blood pressure, abdominal cramps, tremors, bone and muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea, sleeplessness and depression.

100. Chris Greenwood, CB, Albion, 6-1, 193. Ran a 4.41 at Michigan's pro day with a staggering 43-inch vertical jump. This Division III player did what a small-program player has to do to get noticed by the NFL -- dominate every down in every way. Was rarely challenged by opposing quarterbacks, yet his team led the conference in interceptions with 15 because he simply changed the way offenses played. He returned one of his two interceptions for a touchdown.

or hospital. If an eye injury occurs, don't allow your child to touch or rub it, as this may cause more damage. Also, don't flush the eye with water or attempt to put any ointment on it. Instead, cut out the bottom of a paper cup, place it around the eye, and immediately seek medical attention - your child's eyesight may depend on it. If it's a burn, remove clothing from the burned area and run cool, not cold, water over the burn (do not use ice). Call your doctor immediately.
"Oh that we could outlaw all behavior that offends us!

Restaurants with tablecloths are practically an endangered species in L.A. Here, tables are draped in white cloths, which does a lot to tamp down the noise level. Even with music swirling all around us, we could still hear each other. Linens also bring a sense of occasion to the evening. One friend kept remarking at dinner, "I feel as if I've dined, not just eaten."
"To make the product, beef companies use beef trimmings, the small cuts of beef that remain when larger cuts are trimmed down. These trimmings are USDA inspected, wholesome cuts of beef that contain both fat and lean and are nearly impossible to separate using a knife. When these trimmings are processed, the process separates the fat away and the end result is nutritious, lean beef. It’s a process similar to separating cream from milk."
It was Flacco's turn to keep the drive alive as he hit Anquan Boldin twice on third down for completions of 18 and 30 yards. Ray Rice finished off the 13-play series with a 3-yard touchdown run.

"It's a big win for us to get back on the right track," said Panthers coach Ryan Massey, whose team hosts conference leader Edwardsville on Tuesday. "We've had some things not go our way over the last week, and it's a telling stretch of the season. We've got to be playing our basketball at this time. To beat West for the second time this year, it's a testament to our girls. They played hard. They executed down at the end when they needed to."
Aldridge, Batum and Przybilla will all tell you that McMillan is the same coach who averaged nearly 51 regular-season victories between 2008-2011. He's coaching, as usual. Most, but not all, of the team is following. What's obviously absent is Brandon Roy's leadership, which held every corner of the locker room accountable. And while I've wondered, at times, if McMillan is a forever guy in Portland, I can't pin this season on him.
Bibby signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates. He helped them win the 1979 World Series, going 12-4 with a 2.81 ERA, then posting a 2.08 ERA in three postseason starts -- including two in the World Series against the Baltimore Orioles -- although he wasn't credited with a decision.

Centeno's food is rustic in the best sense. You can't call it American eclectic or global or any other convenient label, really. He seems to cook more from his palate than his head. That's how he comes up with such vibrant, lush flavors. The plating is very simple. It certainly doesn't seem as if he's spent nights poring over every page of the hyper-stylized Noma cookbook. He's a chef who likes to cook and likes to eat. You don't need to know much more about him than that.

I dozed off and 20 minutes later awoke to a fantastic sight whose sleek, white form resembled a series of dragonflies strung together. We had reached Millau, home of the Viaduct, completed in 2004 and one of the world's tallest bridges. It towers high above the Tarn Valley. It's as graceful a vision as the paragliders who float above the two steep limestone plateaus it connects — the Causse Noir and Causse du Larzac.

The agency’s executive director, Patrick Foye, announced the crackdown on Friday, the same day Port Authority Police arrested five motorists on the George Washington Bridge, alleging they tried to avoid paying the toll. The five were charged with theft of services. Foye said the arrests marked the beginning of stepped up toll enforcement at the agency’s six crossings.
This live-action confectionary was, in part, a visual joke about the sort of music that Perry makes — pure daydream pop for teenagers, young forever and craving something sweet. "Teenage Dream," her million-selling second album, was literally bubblegum-scented. As niches go, it’s a big one: Perry’s teen-girl audience handily sold out the arena. She has released five singles from "Teenage Dream," four of which have hit No. 1 on the Billboard pop chart. (The other may well be on it its way.) It is reasonable to argue that her candy-coated melodies and chewing-gum dreams have made her the biggest pop star in America.

In a nutshell, at first, I was told I would be getting $250,000 upon maturation. As I got closer to the maturity date, I was told I would get the money that I put into the policy. I was quoted $14,400 in June of last year, about six months before the maturation date. However, my figures come to about $32,200. I have paid $44.70 every three months yearly for 15 years.

Cris is gay. Andrea married an African-American man. Amanda decided to have a family before going to college. Kendra, free-spirited, refused to be anchored into a single role. All this challenged Sandoval. It demanded of him tolerance he had yet to learn and patience he did not have. We teach our children as we know best, but it is the humbling nature of parenthood that from our children we learn how unfinished we are.

Leo's auburn-hued bohemian self disappeared completely in "The Fighter," hidden within a fabulous frosted '80s hair-do, fake teeth and some epic cropped jackets and tight jeans. Also gone is Leo's objectivity toward the real-life woman, who often put the needs of one son, the crack-addled boxing has-been Dick Eckland (Bale) ahead of the other, younger boxing upstart Mickey Ward (Wahlberg) with one last chance at glory.

Bryant caught a pass from Pau Gasol from the left elbow, nailed a 17-foot jumper and prompted everyone at Staples Center to go berserk as if the Black Mamba had never made a shot in his life. Converting a contested layup that reduced the Hornets' lead to 77-69 with 6:24 left created a similar reaction, while Bryant pumped his fist with delight. And there was sure a sense of irony when "M-V-P" chants reigned over Staples Center as he hit one of two free throws to slice the gap to 79-76 with 4:24 left.

* When Hitchcock took over on Nov. 8, he installed a system that featured short shifts to avoid having players out on the ice too long, dragging and vulnerable. The fresher the legs the faster the tempo, and with Hitch as coach the Blues had more shifts per game than any NHL team. The same is true in the NHL postseason.

A: One is that I'm going to start advocating for teachers and their need for professional development as we move forward with the Common Core.

The Olympics are (almost) back, and it's a good time to sing again the ballad of Jesse Owens, the black American track star who put the lie to Adolf Hitler's master-race malarkey at the 1936 Summer Olympics by winning four gold medals.

"What happened to me and what happened to those people down in San Bruno, it should never have happened," Marelich said.
Each 17.3-ounce package of pastry contains two sheets. For best results, thaw the dough overnight in the refrigerator. You can also thaw it at room temperature for an hour or so, but the outside of the dough tends to get soft before the inside is fully thawed. After thawing, it's just a matter of cutting each sheet into triangles, then rolling them into crescents.
Was this embellished? Most likely. But reality never seemed quite big enough to accommodate Clemons.
High unemployment, soaring gas prices and mortgage crisis be hanged: Americans are spending more than ever on the really important things, like the high school prom.
As he did in Florida, Romney was eager to take on the mantle of nominee-in-waiting when he spoke to supporters -- even though Gingrich, Santorum and Paul have said they intend to remain in the race.
"I said that we'd try to get that one rescinded because that was a missed call in that process," Jackson said.
They are vulnerable to a well-played zone, though, or to a gimmick like a triangle-and-2 because opponents can concentrate on Crowder and DJO and not worry much about being destroyed from another angle. Their complementary players are solid but unlikely to beat you in a halfcourt game.
The guardian of Jane Doe No. 1 fought through tears as she explained how the wide-eyed, extroverted girl she raised has become withdrawn, has trouble eating and has uncontrollable anger.
How it all started
WASHINGTON -- With the well-being of millions of Americans and the U.S. economy at a pivotal point, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke faces a crucial decision -- and he faces it almost alone on a world stage.
One name unexpectedly missing from today's announcement was that of Philadelphia Flyers founder Edward M. Snider, who had been among the new ownership group. Former Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania and the businessman Raymond G. Perelman had earlier withdrawn from the consortium.
The iris garden was originally to be 40 by 40 feet, but when it was time to plant the irises, it quickly became apparent that it wasn't adequate space.
I walk my dogs most mornings at a particular greenbelt area. Along the way I meet Bonnie the pitbull and her "dad"; Harley the Australian shepherd and her mom; Anubis the Labrador and his dad; the "parents" of Newfie Buddha, Australian cattle dog Sally, shiba inu Shibi and many others. We always stop to talk with each other while our dogs meet and greet. There's nothing like a happy-go-lucky dog to help break the ice and get people talking. If your daughter is shy, this would be a great way for her to meet people and break out of her shell. Dogs are terrific therapists in this regard.
China's economy grew at an annual rate of 8.9 percent in the last three months of 2011, but the government, which is worried that the economy will overheat, has set a growth target of 7.5 percent this year.
Yet I find it puzzling that these dignitaries argue that making room for others to fully participate in society is viewed as hostility toward Catholicism.
Cassilly had been working on the project for more than a decade and had missed his scheduled opening of 2010. He planned to incorporate the existing industrial silos into an elevated walkway, and then add man-made mountains, beaches, pools and a river with tunnels for rowboats and inner tubes. He had already built part of a castle - turret and all - on the land.
The 10 strikeouts are a season-high for Jimenez and the most by an Indians starter since Justin Masterson fanned 12 White Sox on Sept. 30, 2009. Jimenez owns 11 career double-digit strikeout games.
In late 2008, for example, when GM wanted to move robotic welding lines to Parma to make parts for the LaCrosse, Boneta worked right alongside his members to get the equipment installed.

With $45 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Kane and other researchers are now following 3,000 teachers in six school districts to see if other types of evaluation -- including sophisticated classroom observations, surveys of teachers and reviews of student work -- are also good measures of teacher performance.
“Net punt,” he said. “If you hit it 60 and it’s returned 40, it’s like hitting a 20-yarder for a fair catch, and that doesn’t do us any good. So if I hit a 45-yarder that goes out of bounds, it’s like hitting it 70 and getting it returned 25, except there’s no chance for him to score.
One lasting belief about "The Awakening" is that the Post-Dispatch panned it. This is untrue. Chopin was friends with Post-Dispatch writers and this newspaper's review in 1899 was overwhelmingly positive. Many other reviewers, including Willa Cather (!), believed that Chopin's subject was not fit for a novel. To compare what reviewers said about "The Awakening," go to a University of Virginia website that has several reviews. It includes the Globe-Democrat's assessment ("it is not a healthy book"). The Post-Dispatch's C.L. Deyo says
Prosecutors also are expected to call witnesses to rebut Balfour's alibis. He claimed to have ridden the CTA to a girlfriend's West Side apartment on the day of the slayings, but detectives were able to determine that his fare card had not been used recently, prosecutors have said.
He had also fallen behind on child support payments. Birth certificates and other public records indicate that in addition to the two children he had with his wife, Murray had fathered at least four children with three other women.
But the company released few other details about the system on Tuesday, saying more would be announced in advance of the July 25 All-Star Game in Philadelphia.
Russo and his willing confederates deserve whatever punishment they receive from the federal courts. But they leave behind much collateral damage that can be repaired only through an end to the virtual one-party rule by Cuyahoga County Democrats that enabled Russo and his cronies to thwart any realistic checks and balances for so long, and an even more diligent house-cleaning of county government than the one already under way as part of charter reforms voters enacted last year.
Helena Maldonado, 10, Whiteland, is one of the younger girls in the program. Her mother, Rachel Maldonado, serves as a mentor.
Speedy forward Andy McDonald provided the boost as the Blues soared to the top of the Western Conference standings.
We met J. Kevin Kelley, a little-known employee in the county engineer's office who orchestrated audacious bribery schemes as a confidant to both Russo and Dimora.
"I think the strengths would be the willingness of the people to change and be flexible," Holtman said. "The loyalty of parishioners and past parishioners who grew up here is very strong."
Police and administrators should also use common sense, Edley said.
But there are many hurdles. The scope of the obesity problem is much larger than tobacco ever was: It touches on the food we eat, the beverages we drink, the amount of television we watch, how much we exercise, the way our cities are designed and more. While the variety of policy changes proposed are therefore broader, the political will to enact them has not materialized, in part because "people don't yet perceive a significant personal threat," said William Dietz, director of the division of nutrition, physical activity and obesity at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The Chicago department has been trying to upgrade its tactics and procedures for years. A department that failed to adequately train, equip or even feed officers during the 1968 convention takes pains to make sure mistakes of the past are not repeated.
About 18 months ago, one of her assignments was to write a new ending to a "Twilight" series book. When she kept writing and writing, her parents asked: "Why don't you write your own book?"
They do, however, more than pull their weight.
The treasurer of Democracy in Motion — which donated $7,200 to Wisniewski’s campaign account last October — is Christina Montorio, another of the lawmaker’s former chiefs of staff.
Santorum made the most of it campaigning in Louisiana. With one of his Etch A Sketches in his left hand, he urged Louisiana voters to take Romney's adviser at his word, arguing that the former Massachusetts governor cannot be trusted. "They think they have this nomination in the bag, so it's time to reset. It's time to start moving to the middle," he said. "You have an opportunity here in Louisiana to make a very clear statement: You're not looking for someone who is the Etch A Sketch candidate. You are looking for someone who writes what they believe in in stone and stays true to what they say."
CDC spokeswoman Lola Russell said Tuesday it can take three to four weeks to confirm one case. Identifying an outbreak can take considerably longer than that when cases of foodborne illness occur sporadically, in several states, as has happened in the current outbreak, she said.
The TMZ show, which WOFL-Channel 35 airs at 6:30 weeknights, pleases Stan Knott, the station's general manager.
Cost is an issue. Licensed family child care is cheaper than center-based care in Minnesota -- $7,350 per year for an infant compared to $12,900, according to Child Care Aware. Increased training could result in higher costs for parents; in Wisconsin, for example, the annual cost of family child care for an infant is $8,550.
A federal jury in Tennessee on Friday convicted three Minnesota men for their role in an interstate sex trafficking ring run mostly by Somali gang members. Six others were acquitted of all charges.
But why should they all be so terrified, in unison, at that moment? No reason at all — except to provide Beauvois with a bravura scene.
If I have done something wrong, can you please forgive me?
Charla Nash has two glass eyes. They replaced her real eyes, which were ripped out by a chimpanzee named Travis in a brutal attack Feb. 16, 2009, in Stamford, Conn.
"We're bringing the old machines up to the level of the new equipment we installed," Parma Metal Center manager Al McLaughlin said Thursday. He added that when people go back to work on the refurbished machine, in August, "it's going to be like working on a brand-new press."
Christie added that he was one of Romney’s earliest supporters. He said he is thrilled that he will be the Republican nominee and will work to make sure he gets elected.
No need for you and the kids to volunteer several hours at a food bank or homeless shelter (though if you did, you could certainly suspend the annual "It's better to give than to receive" lecture once kids experienced it for themselves).
White persons: 73 percent.
So when the Eagles went ahead and sent one his way early in the first quarter Friday night, the 5-foot-10, 150-pounder nearly couldn't believe his fortune.
I think that the rail authority must be preserved, at least as a role model for the other government agencies. It must be given reasonable financing and some easily done duties, such as generating one new project a year. Of course, there is a risk that some hot head in the authority will try to start building a real railroad, but I am sure this person will be rendered harmless by the forces inside the rail authority. Nobody with good sense cuts the branch on which he sits. And until now, the rail authority has demonstrated an astonishing self-preservation instinct.
Scot Thompson without a doubt. He is an absolute legend for his on-the-field heroics and his community work off the field. One of the finest people I have ever met.
The bill, which President Obama is expected to sign, will
But this is what Kansas has reaped by ignoring the needs of its most vulnerable citizens. The bill may finally be coming due.
InterMedia does not report on North Korea's allowing the foreign media unprecedented access to North Korea to report on last month's centennial of the nation's founder — including its failed attempt to launch a long-range rocket in defiance of U.N. sanctions — and whether that augurs any loosening of state control.
The inclusion of clips from low-budget horror classics like "Carnival of Souls" and "Night of the Living Dead" only highlights all that is missing, as those films made more from less, while "The Fields" simply feels like something less.
"Kids need to have things to do after school and on weekends," she said. "That way they don't hang out on the streets."
"I think people will think through this on their own," he said.
But he also has had a few missteps that have drawn the ire of Jewish groups, most notably in 2009 when he lifted the excommunication of a traditionalist Catholic bishop who had denied the extent of the Holocaust by saying no Jews were gassed during World War II.
For large chains such as Hilton or Holiday Inn, the challenge is more likely about time than money because of their deep pockets.

Hall, the HHS official, said politics are not playing any role in the department's decisionmaking. He noted that in 2005 CDC's advisory committee issued a statement concluding there was insufficient evidence at that time to lower the blood-lead level of concern. "Since then additional scientific evidence has confirmed the need to prevent lead exposures from occurring and that adverse health effects occur at blood-lead levels below 10," Hall said.

Stoudemire revealed he spent 10 hours a day on rehab after re-injuring his back against the Pistons on March 24, all the while hearing Anthony’s Knicks were better without him. Uncharacteristically, Stoudemire declined all interview requests during his absence.
Christie promoted his proposed 10 percent income tax cut and argued the state’s economy is turning around due to his stewardship. He said he had to “say no” to things early so he could “say yes” to essential services now.

Next Saturday’s section will include a cover story that shows how a Happy Valley family reinvented their spec home to create a much nicer living space. It features how-to, practical advice, such as whether you should plant your tomatoes now, given our cold, wet spring. (Hint: None are going in the ground yet at my house.) Plus it will regularly include features such as “One-day wonders: Quick fixes that will make a big impact in your home.”
Dr. Divy Kikani, a psychiatrist who treated Gardner for bipolar disorder, wrote that his patient was "extremely remorseful" for inappropriate sexual relations with two girls, ages 13 and 14. He said Gardner was "highly motivated" to get help.

The pets "are always so happy to see you and it's like that every day," said manager Robert Casas about the best part of his job. "It's a lot of fun and it's such a good experience."
Kasich supporters viewed the narrow vote as a minor setback that showed how weak DeWine has become with the GOP base.
Walben’s purchase: a dozen beers in a blue carton.
The complicated combinations and techniques are never emphasized by the waiters. In an attempt to keep things low-key, I presume, they simply put the plates down with minimal description.
Head coach Jim Tressel said he has no idea how the competition might go, but he emphasized how important it is for Miller to get reps in the spring, something Pryor wasn't able to do as a freshman because he didn't enroll early. Bollman said the competition may not have a clear winner by the season opener, meaning more than one quarterback could play significant minutes.
Previous maps of the floor around the wreckage were incomplete, said Parks Stephenson, a Titanic historian who consulted on the 2010 expedition. Studying the site with old maps was like trying to navigate a dark room with a weak flashlight.
"We are entirely mobilized for this legislative campaign," said Jean-Francois Cope, UMP president.

Only four patrol offices -- Portland, Salem, Central Point and Bend -- reached the 24/7 standard, and that was on paper. The hiring didn't account for gaps caused by vacations, training and other absences. The new bodies went first to offices along Interstate 5, then along I-84 and U.S. 97, through Central Oregon. Coastal offices along U.S. 101 were to be next for more troopers.

I tried to pass off her comments as a joke. I had never heard anything like that before, and I figured that the budget veto was just pure incompetence. But she said she was serious.
There are several authors whom I consider favorites, but there is no one else who makes me as happy as G.K. Chesterton does. At risk of sounding like someone's grandmother, G.K. Chesterton is delightful. I assign that word not only to his writing, but to the man himself. He was clumsy and almost pathologically absent-minded. At 6'4" and almost 300 pounds he was a conspicuous figure, but seemed to determined to be more conspicuous still. He usually wore a cape and crumpled hat, and carried a swordstick in hand. G.K. Chesterton was the sort of person who couldn't help laughing at his own jokes, a weakness less forgivable if his jokes weren't so consistently funny.
Restivo, who said many clients are fathers behind in child support desperately looking for work, railed: "Running this program has taught me a tough lesson -- that Clevelanders lavish attention on the quirkiest of causes, but won't donate a dollar to help fathers trying to reconnect with their children."
Coby Fleener, tight end, Stanford: While ogling quarterback Andrew Luck, did Elway fall in love with the guy catching those perfect spirals? It would make sense for an old quarterback to develop a man crush on a tight end with big-play capability. It also makes more sense than taking a running back in the first round.
Whether you crave the country sass of Miranda Lambert or always wondered what it'd be like to see Kanye West and Jay-Z share a stage, the upcoming fall months should put a smile on any music enthusiast's face. Cutting the stacked line-ups of new albums and tours down to 10 each was hard, but after many sleepless nights and a few anxious freak-outs, here's our final list.
With the enormous funding problems facing the District this simply is not the time to be distracted with a damaging, radical and needlessly time-consuming experiment in grading.
In the end, he must do what he thinks is best for the diocese as a whole, and he will have to do it in full accordance with church law.

For instance, try flying north of the border to Quebec City instead of to Paris, which traditionally becomes one of the summer's most-crowded — and most expensive — destinations. Quebec City is "right out of a fairy tale, in a French-speaking Canadian province," McGinnis said.

Graeme McDowell won the 2010 U.S. Open, riding a six-month wave that included a clutch performance for Europe's victorious Ryder Cup squad. He said winning a major changed his expectations for the worse. The pressure to live up to the new standard got to him in 2011, when he failed to win a tournament on the PGA or European tours.

I'd hazard to say that most of the dudes behind the "Brokeback" mashups haven't seen the film. No matter; having parodied it, they'll want to check it out. And I have a dream, see. I dream that somewhere out in Bushland people who missed "Brokeback Mountain" in theaters, either through their own fear or their neighborhood Cineplex's refusal to show it, will feel safe ordering it from Netflix and watching it in the privacy of their shag-carpeted living rooms, sandwiched between "American Pie II" and that sanctimonious exercise in sadomasochism, "The Passion of the Christ." Maybe they'll even toss in "Evil Dead," just for chuckles.
"Before I won the lottery, I had to go to work, I had to do this, I had to do that, I had to, had to, had to. Now, if friends call up and ask if we want to go on a cruise, we don't have to plan years in advance. We can just go."

What has changed, but not as much as I'd have imagined, is the food. For the last few months, Jason Travi, who has worked at Spago, La Terza, Fraîche and is now corporate executive chef for Best's restaurant group, has been tweaking the menu at Firefly. Though most of the dishes are new, they're all in the same rustic Mediterranean mode established by former chef Gary Menes. If anything, they're more generic than Menes' graceful originals were. (Menes left to open Palate Food & Wine in Glendale and now is looking to open his own place.)

Bottorff acknowledged that the company had long told regulators it was complying with industry standards that called for operators to test lines during installation for such problems as bad welds, the flaw that contributed to the San Bruno pipeline rupture.

Will win: Perry is out of her league. And as much as I admire Lady Gaga, "The Fame Monster" really amounts to a glorified EP. The buzz is that Eminem, who leads this year's hopefuls with 10 nominations, is in line for some major Grammy love. But if Steely Dan could trounce the chart-topping rapper in this same category 10 years ago, I wouldn't put it past Lady Antebellum this time.
Actually, both theories are correct -- and neither is. It's true that Wall Street took too many risks while government regulators watched passively; it's also true that the government's aggressive promotion of homeownership contributed to real estate speculation. But the fact that these theories are not mutually exclusive suggests that both were consequences of some larger cause. Just so. What ultimately explains the financial crisis and Great Recession is an old-fashioned boom and bust, of which the housing collapse was merely a part.

It doesn't help that these obvious characters feel the need to express every thought in the most trite terms, mouthing dialogue flatter than the stretch of Nebraska territory where the Union Pacific started its march west.

Scores of cities and towns in New Jersey have been touched by deaths on the rails. They occur on commuter and freight lines, from the state's congested north to its rural south. No community, however, has seen more of it in recent years than tiny Garfield, a working-class city of 2.1 square miles, 30,000 people and four rail crossings. Since 1998, 17 people have died there.

By now, you are probably wondering: where is the Big Boi album? Well, it's here, sad to say. It never clicked for me, and I'm not entirely sure why. I always love Big Boi's rhyming, and some of the individual tracks are fantastic, but I find the second half of the record a real chore.

I zone out around there and only re-engage when "Shine Blockas" comes on, and that type of thing never happened with an OutKast set. I adore them to pieces, and I will happily pay money for anything they put out, but I'm convinced now -- Andre and Antawn really do need each other.
